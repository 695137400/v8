For a general context, it seems it can be hard to use immediate indexes in wasm memory operations but, I believe, once we get to this stage in TurboFan we should be able to modify them to use immediate indexes.\n\nDoes this make any more sense? Do you have any there any particular questions?",

And it\u0027s for ProtectedLoads only for legacy reasons, that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been benchmarking on arm64, for a while... :)\nMy downstream patch adds ProtectedStore support, I just need to run the benchmarks on my x64 machine and then I\u0027ll push it.\n\nAs for the flag, there is a chance it could cause regressions, but I think I\u0027ve tweaked the heuristics enough that it is good the vast majority of time.",
