The change there is as simple (and targeted) as possible; per the TODO comment in there, we could consider to only set the MAP_JIT flag on memory we\u0027re planning to use for code, but that\u0027s information we don\u0027t currently have when reserving address space, so it\u0027d be a somewhat bigger refactoring.\n\nThe skipped tests require more work, but don\u0027t seem to be critical for production code.",
