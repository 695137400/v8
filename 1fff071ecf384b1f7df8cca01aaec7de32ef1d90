We also haven\u0027t ported/tested this feature on AIX yet. If you need to build a PPC binary with this feature enabled then please compile it with the flag added to your args.gn",

      "message": "How will we get test coverage so that upstream doesn\u0027t inadvertently break this feature when refactoring?\n\nAlso, for Linux systems we probably do want compression and sandboxing both to avoid ppc64 using more RAM than a comparable x64/arm64 server and for the security benefits of the sandbox.  Is there a potential path to resolving the issues short of having each downstream distro enable by default?  Would a patch that only enables by default on Linux/ppc64 (handling AIX/ppc64 as a separate system entirely) be acceptable?\n\nEither way, having the main sandbox patches in tree, even deactivated by default, would greatly simplify our future maintainance efforts..",
