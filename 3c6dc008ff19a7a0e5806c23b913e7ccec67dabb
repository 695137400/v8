      "message": "I\u0027m not super happy with this fix, because it makes BranchIfFloat64Compare have a different layout than other BranchControlNode. Still, it doesn\u0027t grow its size (because `operation_` is a uint8_t, which means that due to padding we had a few extra bytes available).\nIt could have been maybe cleaner to have a BranchIfFloat64CompareZero node or something like that, which we would only use in this case, but 1) it\u0027s slightly redundant with BranchIfFloat64Compare and 2) it would share most of BranchIfFloat64Compare code, which is a bit annoying, and tend to suggest that maybe it\u0027s not a super clean alternative either...\n\nWhat do you think?",
