This makes sure if anything we load here is movable during GC (not 100 % sure if that can happen), that we track (and update) this tagged value correctly.",

      "message": "I wonder if we should actually get rid of `LOAD_TAGGED_ROOT`, as apparently we never load a tagged from root.\n\nI think the `__ BitcastWordPtrToTagged(...)` within a `LOAD_TAGGED_ROOT` would only be useful if it prevented us in the future from using a `LOAD_ROOT` with a `MemoryRepresentation::TaggedPointer()`, but since `LOAD_ROOT` does not have a `type` parameter, this may be unlikely to happen. Maybe there could be a comment in `LOAD_ROOT` that a `LOAD_TAGGED_ROOT` should not exist, but I\u0027m not sure anyone would see this comment when they want to introduce a `LOAD_TAGGED_ROOT`.",
