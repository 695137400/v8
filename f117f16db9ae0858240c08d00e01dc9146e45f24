      "message": "Thanks for this patch! The code change itself looks good. \n\nTests for the Wasm C API are in test/wasm-api-test/, and the new test should be added there. Either pick one of the existing files (maybe startup-errors.cc, which sounds fitting for validation), or create a new file if you prefer (e.g. regressions.cc); it probably also makes sense to add a `Validate()` helper to wasm-api-tests.h in the style of the `Compile()` that\u0027s already there.\n\nthird_party/wasm-api/ should remain an unmodified (if slightly outdated) copy of the upstream repo (github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api), so we shouldn\u0027t add any custom stuff there (in particular to make future updates easier).",
