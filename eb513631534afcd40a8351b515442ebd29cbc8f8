      "message": "Every time you use std::memory_order_relaxed, I\u0027m wondering if it is really worth it, and if it is actually correct. This code here does not seem hot, so I think it\u0027s not worth having memory_order_relaxed.\n\nIn my understanding, std::memory_order_relaxed does not give you any guarantee which version of a value you actually read, or when a written value actually becomes visible to other threads. In that case, why do you read this value in the first place? Can you not just use max_concurrency_, and avoid loading current_concurrency_ in the first place?",
