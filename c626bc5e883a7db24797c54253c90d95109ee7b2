      "message": "Hi Clemens, serialized_code_start is now \"4 byte\" aligned due to this change therefore we are not taking this if statement anymore, buffer isn\u0027t re-aligned any longer and we are getting failures under ppc:\n\nFatal error in ../../src/base/memory.h, line 22\n# Debug check failed: IsAligned(addr, alignof(T)).\n\nI\u0027m not sure how using \"new byte[code_size]\" is 4/8 byte aligning this since the type input a byte, however, changing kInt32Size above to kInt64Size assure the if statement is taken and tests pass.\n\nWas wondering if this is the proper way of fixing it?",

      "message": "It looks like checking for kSystemPointerSize alignment would be the right solution.\n\nAnd I agree, the byte array allocation below does not guarantee the alignment either, but I guess most existing allocators just naturally guarantee system word alignment. You could put a TODO or at least a comment to say that this is not 100% safe, but seems to work well enough in practice.\n\nAlternatively, you could overallocate the {aligned_buffer} by {kSystemPointerSize - 1} bytes, and adjust the start pointer to the first aligned address within that allocation.",
