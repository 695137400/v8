      "message": "I remember having this discussion with Tobias recently, and jump tables were disabled for builtins specifically. Found the switch here: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/optimized-compilation-info.cc?l\u003d64\u0026rcl\u003d19afaa1436ef38c86f7ea9a73a6ae9e43ec71ad1\n\nThe more robust check (at the link above) would be Builtins::IsBuiltinId(builtin_index) if we can get it from somewhere. The OptimizedCompilationInfo ctor just below in L74 has access to it. Anyway, if you add the bytecode handler kind there then all should be well :)",

      "message": "We explicitly use a jump table in InvokeIntrinsic to decode the intrinsic I\u0027d, doing it as an if/else would probably be a fair bit slower. Is there any way we could recode this as offsets, or relocate the absolute addresses on embedding?",
