I can\u0027t see an ELF toolchain doing that, but I suppose a Mac/Mach-O toolchain could.\n\nDo you have any information that could confirm that hypothesis?  e.g.\n\n* disassembly of binaries showing that the ProbeMemory function gets split up\n* standalone test cases showing that symbols declared with \".globl\"  get treated as starting new sections\n* any references to this in docs or other code?\n\nUnfortunately I don\u0027t have a Mac to test this out on.",
