      "message": "There might be an issue here. The RwxMemoryWriteScope::SetExecutable() counts how many times was RwxMemoryWriteScope created and if there will be more than one RwxMemoryWriteScope active on the stack then this call will just decrease the counter but not actually modify the permissions.\n\nWe might want to call base::MemoryProtectionKey::SetPermissionsForKey() from here directly. We could have exposed this specific call from RwxMemoryWriteScope but I don\u0027t think it makes sense.\n\nClemens, WDYT?",
