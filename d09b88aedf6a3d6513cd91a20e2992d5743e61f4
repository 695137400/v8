      "message": "Is there any value in supporting such a low --wasm-max-initial-code-space-reservation? Can we not just define a minimum value for this flag?\n\nIf not, this CL LGTM, but I think checking the value of the flag would be a nicer solution.",

      "message": "There are tests that explicitly set such a low limit, in order to force multiple code spaces to be created. That\u0027s fine, as long as you don\u0027t have too many functions. Both combined (low limit and many functions) creates the problem that the jump tables take more space than the limit allows, and in that case I think failing with OOM is reasonable.",
