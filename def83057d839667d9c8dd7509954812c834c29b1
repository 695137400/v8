      "message": "Replacing the template by actual implementations increases the binary size for methods that aren\u0027t actually used. The template mechanism guarantees that only those methods which are used are being compiled. If an event does not have the matching method to call (so if it\u0027s not thread-safe) this compilation will fail instead of having an UNREACHABLE which will only be discovered at runtime. So I\u0027m not seeing the benefits of the explicit version implemented here.",
