      "message": "Personally I would just make this a standard runtime function unless there are really good reasons not to. It\u0027s pretty unusual to use an external reference for runtime type calls, and I am not convinced the two benefits you mention are worth breaking with convention in this case, particularly since the code is not entirely self-contained in this function (e.g., calling out to HandlerTable::LookupRange) and something might change in those later which requires an entry / exit frame to be on the stack.",
