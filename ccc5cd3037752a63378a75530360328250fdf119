As far as I can see, there are no other node replacements that only null the lower half of the output. \nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/compiler/int64-lowering.cc?q\u003dint64-loweri\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026g\u003d0\u0026l\u003d503\n\nI have a follow-up CL that partially implements the shift optimization, and fixes the case here as well, but I\u0027d like to keep that separate as this needs to be merged to M70.",
