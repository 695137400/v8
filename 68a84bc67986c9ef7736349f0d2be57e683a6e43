      "message": "Ah, yeah sorry my bad, I was thinking of {BigInt64Array} (see https://v8.dev/blog/bigint#two-new-types-of-typedarrays) without realizing. But now that I realize it is tied to BitInt I see how this complicates things because one can only store a BigInt (i.e. a literal with the \"n\" suffix is required) into them. If the overhead of switching to BigInt here is too heavy and introduces more complication than it solves, then I am also fine with the current approach. I leave the decision up to you.",
