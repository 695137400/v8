      "message": "Hello, recently I wrote [a blog post](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architectures-and-processors-blog/posts/webassembly-bitmask-operations) on the Arm developer site about the various options to implement the Wasm vector bitmask operations on the 64-bit Arm architecture. This change follows the recommendation from the blog post, but I will repeat the main performance points here - when the corresponding instruction sequences are benchmarked against each other, the new one (i.e. the one using the polynomial multiplication) improves latency for 8-bit elements by 56.49% on Cortex-X1 and by 20.43% on Cortex-A55. For 16-bit elements the numbers are 7.66% and 16.67% respectively; the throughput numbers are similar.",
