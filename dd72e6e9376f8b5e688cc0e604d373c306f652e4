      "message": "All: the 1-line fix is in PS5:\n\n -  Call(EntryFromBuiltinIndexAsOperand(target));\n +  call(EntryFromBuiltinIndexAsOperand(target));\n\n`Call` (upper-case) has atom-specific perf tuning that changes the emitted instr sequence. That of course breaks assumptions about the size of deopt exits on x64. The trivial fix is to use raw `call` instead.\n\nI also added a few tests. \n\nTBRing + landing now to avoid having to rebase this but feel free to comment.",
