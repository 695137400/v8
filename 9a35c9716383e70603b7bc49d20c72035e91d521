      "message": "Thanks Markus!\n\nPlease don\u0027t get me wrong, as I think my comments could be interpreted as \"push-back\" against using ICU provided methods instead of our own implementation. That\u0027s definetly not the case. It\u0027s just that making better use of them requires changes to existing code and I don\u0027t want to mix those changes with this CL.\nAll your comments are definetly very helpful and I will consider all of them in a follow-up, where I will explore replacing own implementations with ICU provided API.",
