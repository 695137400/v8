It was previously set to include possibly AVX, but now it can\u0027t be in there anymore, right?\n\nIsn\u0027t this even returning false on the first call? And wouldn\u0027t that mean that also avx2 is set to not supported?",

All our hardware has avx support, and e.g. on clusterfuzz trials we just pass single flags like --no-sse42. Those won\u0027t have an effect any longer now, right?\n\nCould we also add a logic that gives the \"no\" flags precedence and infers the \"higher\" no flags?",
