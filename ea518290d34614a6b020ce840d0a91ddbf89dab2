Could we instead split out SmiTaggingConstants (for kSmiShiftSize and kSmiValueSize) and use them to generate the constants below (which are what I think you need for globals.h/checks.h), then still have the convertion routines here. Doing this would make me happier about including them in v8config.h.",
