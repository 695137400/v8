Could we instead split out SmiTaggingConstants (for kSmiShiftSize and kSmiValueSize) and use them to generate the constants below (which are what I think you need for globals.h/checks.h), then still have the convertion routines here. Doing this would make me happier about including them in v8config.h.",

      "message": "Sure I\u0027m happy to consider any split/filename.\n\nFor Ulan, the reason I want to do this split is because I have another change that generates some header files using an executable that depends on a very small number of V8 source files. These files end up including v8.h via globals.h.\n\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/1209304\n\nWith this change it fails to compile on MSVC because v8.h declares external symbols my executable doesn\u0027t provide. I could probably solve this another way by ensuring my executable doesn\u0027t have BUILDING_V8_SHARED declared, but I think globals.h should avoid depending on such a large file anyway.",
