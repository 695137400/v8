      "message": "This looks mostly correct to me but it occurs to me that it might cleaner to make a different async \"body\" function, so that CreateArrayFromIterableAsynchronously _only_ deals with the iterable case, and the new function (CreateArrayFromArrayLikeAsynchronously?) would only deal with the array-like case.\n\nWe know whether the input is arraylike or an iterable synchronously ahead of time, so we can make the decision ahead of time. This function is really 2 different functions in 1.\n\nThis way, we can have tailor-fit contexts for each version as well. Might be easier to read all around as well.\n\nSorry for not thinking of this idea earlier. WDYT?",
