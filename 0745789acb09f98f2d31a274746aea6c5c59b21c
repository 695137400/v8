      "message": "Hi Clemens,\n\nFrom a performance perspective I\u0027m not 100% sure and I can ask around.\n\nHowever, from a correctness pov, discussing with Georgia, we remembered a previous unwinder issue, where it was important for the frame marker to be pushed on the stack first. Otherwise the unwinder may crash interpreting uninitialised memory as a frame marker: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id\u003d9907\n\nI\u0027m not sure if we fundamentally fixed this issue at the time, or if we just made less likely to occur.\n\nHope this is helpful!",
