      "message": "Benedikt, you were part of the original CL by Philip where we discussed the design in length: https://crrev.com/c/2429265\n\nIn particular, we decided to put the proxy object in wasm-js.cc, because this is where the existing API objects are implemented (which deal with Locals or FunctionCallbackInfo). wasm-js.cc is not the perfect place, and I am totally open to move it to another cc file, but it does not belong in wasm-debug.cc, which only contained v8-internal implementation before. The implementation of the proxy object would ideally even live in src/debug or src/inspector.\n\nCan we refactor this to a state where the proxy lives in a separate file, and uses wasm-debug.cc as its \"backend\" for getting the actual data?",
