      "message": "I\u0027m pretty sure there is not much of a performance difference, if any. No iteration happens when comparing with the empty string, it will certainly compare length first. In fact, the `.length` version will be a `LoadIC` that collects a fixed number of String maps and can become megamorphic leading to much worse performance if too many different kinds of strings are found, while this doesn\u0027t happen with `\u003d\u003d \"\"`. So, as always in JS, actual performance is extremely tricky to predict and I\u0027d suggest to focus on readability unless you measured that it matters.",
