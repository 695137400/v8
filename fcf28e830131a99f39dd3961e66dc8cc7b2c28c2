The GPU builders used an old Chromium revision which was stuck on this problem:\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+log/6c027df5ee43a3c4573787092455b37ad5891352/content/test/gpu/gpu_tests/test_expectations/pixel_expectations.txt\n\nSo this CL was innocent, sorry for the revert. Please go ahead and reland.",
