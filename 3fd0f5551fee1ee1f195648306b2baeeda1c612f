      "message": "gcmole is complaining because the c++ compiler could deref the receiver (locale_holder) before the allocation of the string, and then after allocation we could have a GC leading to the deref\u0027d receiver pointer pointing to garbage, as the GC could move the receiver. We need to move the allocation to a separate line to prevent this from happening.",
