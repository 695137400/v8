      "message": "I was seeing a strange behavior when I used `vceq(dst, dst, dst)` to set `dst` to all ones. The regress-1112124.js test case would fail, because the output would alternate between -1 and 0.\nI took a look at godbolt to see what is the correct way to set a NEON register to all ones, and it looked like vmov (imm) was the right way. Since the assembler did not yet support vmov (imm), I had to implement it.\n\nBill for everything, Jakob for simulator (OWNERS), and v8-arm-ports to help review the arm simulator, assembler, diasm. Ptal, thanks!",
