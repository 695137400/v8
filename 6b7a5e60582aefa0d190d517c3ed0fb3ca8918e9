      "message": "Thanks for rebasing and separating it/putting it behind a build flag. (Sorry for the late reply, was OOO due to several public holidays.)\n\nI left a first round of comments, mostly only checking that the interpreter is well separated from the rest of the code. In particular, I didn\u0027t review the files in `interpreter/`, as discussed. I still have ~30-35 files ahead of me that I will look at in the next days.\n\nIf multiple rounds of reviewing becomes too slow, we could also schedule a call, but let\u0027s first see if we can do without. In a later round, we will have to add more people to review files where I\u0027m not an OWNER or not familiar.\n\nI also briefly checked `d8` binary size, x64 non-component release build:\n```\nlast commit before this CL:           38671608 bytes\nthis CL, v8_wasm_interpreter \u003d false: 38671872 bytes\nthis CL, v8_wasm_interpreter \u003d true:  39318000 bytes\n```\nThat looks fine to me (I would be interested to know where the slight difference is coming from, but no biggie).\n\n@Michael Achenbach: Do we already have an (fyi?) bot which we could run this on?",
