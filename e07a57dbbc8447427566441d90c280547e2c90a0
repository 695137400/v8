      "message": "Not too sure, this has to do with register allocation, we might be able to make the cctest a bit bigger to have it choose different registers.\nA bigger change would be some global mode to also force all registers to be unique, that way we can exercise all tests at one go, but that\u0027s a very big switch.",

      "message": "I\u0027m wondering what test suite we can come up here that tests registers spilling more - clusterfuzz generates some, but it might be worthwhile to see if we can add a set of tests (perhaps a fuzzer itself) that are guaranteed to spill. I realize this discussion should be independent of this change, mostly thinking out aloud so change lgtm.",

That should always be a safe and equivalent replacement. Although I\u0027m not sure how we can do that, adding a FLAG inside of UseRegister might not be a mergeable change.",
