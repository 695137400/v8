      "message": "Hi Michael, I did some debugging with one of the failed test, and here is what I found.\n\nWith this CL:\nWhen WebMediaPlayerImplTest::~WebMediaPlayerImplTest() is called, the code path goes to IncrementalMarkingJob::Task::RunInternal().\n\nWithout this CL:\nThe code path goes to Sweeper::IncrementalSweeperTask::RunInternal().\n\nWhy does it crash? The IncrementalMarkingJob::Task::RunInternal() calls into Heap::FinalizeIncrementalMarkingIfComplete(), and eventually calls the ChromeClientImpl::RequestBeginMainFrameNotExpected(). Note that in a unit test, we don\u0027t really need to create a \"WebFrameWidgetImpl\" and that\u0027s why it crashed.\n\nDoes that help? Please let me know so that and I am happy to debug further.",
