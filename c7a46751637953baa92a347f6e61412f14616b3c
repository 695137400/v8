      "message": "I\u0027ve cleaned this up a little bit, to share code with the 32-bit versions, and have a conditional instruction to clear the high word. \n\nThinking about this a little more, I\u0027m almost convinced that the Narrow should just be handled in int64-lowering, by replacing the high word with a zero constant because the return value is not visible to other threads. I\u0027ll do that once this lands, and I add some better worker based JS tests.",
