If possible we should make them the same, as the TODO says.\n\nishell@, v8:4153 looks mostly done, but we never actually made the TypedArray and ArrayBuffer max lengths equal. All the V8 tests pass (ignoring the downstream failures in blink and Node). Am I missing anything or is it actually this easy? ðŸ˜Š\n\nIf I\u0027m not missing anything, I\u0027ll fix the downstream issues.",
