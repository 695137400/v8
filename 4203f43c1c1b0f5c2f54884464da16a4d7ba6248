      "message": "Nit: I guess nested ?: operators is a bit tricky to read. What about moving this to a function (e.g. `BlackAllocation ComputeBlackAllocation(IsNewGeneration)`) and use proper if-else statements? Alternatively I suppose we could also just store IsNewGeneration directly as field (or as boolean) in MainAllocator and use this value together with v8_flags.sticky_mark_bits in `IsBlackAllocationEnabled`. Then we wouldn\u0027t need the BlackAllocation enum and the black allocation logic would all be contained in that method. Wdyt?",
