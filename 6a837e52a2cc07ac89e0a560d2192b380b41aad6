      "message": "I would have expected the FeedbackNexus-NexusConfig interaction to work in one of two ways:\n1) FeedbackNexus checks config (mode) to decide what to do and how to do it.\n2) FeedbackNexus does reads/writes/... by calling the respective method on NexusConfig, and it\u0027s up to those methods to decide how to do it.\n\nIt seems that in your CL we have something in-between. Was that a conscious decision?",

      "message": "I wanted to push as much as possible into the NexusConfig regarding \"how to do it.\" However, the cache seemed better positioned in the FeedbackNexus, because it\u0027s a cache of the values of a particular slot(s) in the vector. Whereas if this caching behavior lived in the NexusConfig there are many questions regarding lifetime of the NexusConfig (very long lived, like in the isolate, or maybe new ones are created each time we kick off a compilation thread for the Background case), as well as what to cache and for how long (different vectors, different slots).\n\nSo, I do admit that I answered this question rather organically (ie, less consciously than I might have), but we have the NexusConfig to express:\n\na) opinions about capabilities (can_write(), etc.) which the FeedbackNexus can use to disallow certain methods,\nb) complete control over read/write of vector slots (thus hiding the locking),\nc) complete control over handle creation\n\nBut the cache lives in the FeedbackNexus, which takes it\u0027s cue from the Configuration.",
