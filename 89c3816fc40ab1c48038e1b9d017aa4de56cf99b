      "message": "Not sure I fully understand what this change is trying to achieve. What\u0027s the difference between `base::Vector` and `v8::MemorySpan`? I always considered one the internal thing and the other the external one (similar to `base::Optional` vs `v8::Maybe`).\nBoth can point to either stack-allocated or heap-allocated memory, no?\n\nAll usages that were replaced in this CL indeed used stack-allocated memory (either directly, or via `base::VectorOf({...})` which constructs an initializer list which has a stack-allocated backing array). Did any of these cause issues?",
