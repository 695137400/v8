Once it lands, then the test will pass because the console implementation will be aligned with the webexposed test expectations.\n\nAs mentioned in the commit description, this CL implements a web-exposed change. It is small enough to not justify an I2S, as per chrishtr@\u0027s judgement. Chris, please register your support for this here.",
