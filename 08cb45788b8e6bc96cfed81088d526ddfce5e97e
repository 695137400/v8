      "message": "Thanks for the patch! Did you consider using a `Word32Select` node, which lowers to a `cmov` instruction? I don\u0027t know which version is faster, but it might be worth a try.\nAlso, it would be good if you could also provide a Turboshaft version of this optimization, to make sure we don\u0027t lose it once we switch to Turboshaft. Let me know if you have questions or need help with Turboshaft.",
