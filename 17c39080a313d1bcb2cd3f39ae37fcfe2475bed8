      "message": "+1 to Leszek\u0027s suggestion of hiding the command line flag on snapshot builds. \n\nAs an alternative - we could modify the logic so that interrupt_budget isn\u0027t hard-coded into the snapshot (i.e., having the flag update a memory location which is known to Ignition and used by Ignition as the value to reset the interrupt budget, rather than being hard-coded into the machine-code. This would take a bit more work, so I\u0027m fine with landing as a no-snapshot only flag in the meantime if you want to fuzz this.",
