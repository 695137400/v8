      "message": "This skips the write barrier because we overwrite the slow with the exact reference. However, the write barrier is only invoked *after* updating that slot, so we don\u0027t have the old value to check this. So I think it\u0027s better to use UPDATE_WRITE_BARRIER here and in case this does anything to performance, we should probably add a method for setting that second slot without that first one.",
