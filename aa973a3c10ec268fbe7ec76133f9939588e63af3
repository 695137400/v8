      "message": "TBH I find the entire case-folding implementation very confusing. For example, why do we have both AddUnicodeCaseEquivalents and CharacterRange::AddCaseEquivalents, with the latter looking like a more complete version of the former? Why the weird mechanism of calling the former early, and only calling the latter if the former wasn\u0027t applied? Could we merge the two?\n\nAnyways, the cause of this particular bug was that we weren\u0027t preserving flags correctly, therefore we incorrectly skipped the CharacterRange::AddCaseEquivalents call.\n\nPTAL.",

      "message": "Those are good questions. I rewrote AddCaseEquivalents, but I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ve ever seen AddUnicodeCaseEquivalents. It looks like it was added here: https://codereview.chromium.org/1599303002/diff/220001/src/regexp/jsregexp.cc. At that point it fell back to the non-Unicode version in the absence of ICU.\n\nIt stopped falling back to AddCaseEquivalents in this patch: https://codereview.chromium.org/2725583002.\n\nThis was the change that added ICU support to AddCaseEquivalents: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/1478710. \n\nIt\u0027s pretty tangled. The support for flipping flags on and off mid-regexp doesn\u0027t help either. AFAIK that feature has no path to standardization. Have we considered removing it?\n\nAs far as this patch goes: I\u0027m not clear why the no_i18n build fails without these flags, but the regular build succeeds. Can you shed any light?",
