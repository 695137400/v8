      "message": "Hi Clemens,\n\nThis CL fix a bug in long branch optimization on mips, PTAL, thanks!\n\nBesides, since our company, Loongson Technology is the main if not only maintainer of mips ports, I wonder if I could request to be a v8 committer? If so, our only mips related work will be much more convenient.\n\nAccording to v8.dev\u0027s docs, I need a committer to nominate me, and you have reviewd a large part of my CLs, could you help to do that? Thanks in advance!",
