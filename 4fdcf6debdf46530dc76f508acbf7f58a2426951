We could be pushing something out of range, or making some otherwise-broken code. (Bugs like this can lead to unintended code execution and as such can be a security risk.)\n\nCan we put the MaybeCheckConstPool before the BlockConstPoolScope in this function? (Ditto for other cases where we need to pass \"false\".)",
