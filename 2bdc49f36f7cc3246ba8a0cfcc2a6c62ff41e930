      "message": "ptal.\n\nThis is the direction I want to go now for the external \"marking\" of in construction objects.\nPlease note that the object don\u0027t actually need to marked. Any mechanism that prevents us from pushing the same object multiple times to the worklist would suffice to prevent bloating the worklist (in this CL the Contains method is meant as that CL).\n\nWhatever mechanism we go with needs to work both the mutator thread and on concurrent threads. I started with having a standalone std::unordered_set that is accessed directly and is guarded by a lock. Wanting to avoid obtaining the lock for each object, lead me back to our worklist design.\n\nRight now I\u0027m using std::unordered_set in the Segments instead of the array we usually have. I see this as a trade-off between cost of insertion and cost of querying. Querying will happen for every in construction object, possibly multiple times although probably not often, while insertion should happen at most once per thread. Thus I think we need to prioritize faster querying.\nWe could also use a std::vector or the arrays we currently have which would mean faster insertion but would require iterating over the array for querying.\n(if we decide that the in-construction worklist is expected to remain small enough, it might be acceptable to use the existing arrays and add the Contains method to all worklists).",

      "message": "I started with a side data structure with a lock like you describe. Then I realized that the data structure with the lock holds the exact same data as the worklist we have for in-construction objects.\nThat meant that we can drop the worklist.\nThen I became concerned that we need to get the lock for each in-construction object we encounter and wanted to use some local cache, which led me back to our worklist design.\nIntegrating it into the worklist also simplifies flushing the objects to the previously_not_fully_constructed worklist, assuming we do drop the regular not_fully_constructed worklist since all the data is already stored in the side data structure.

      "message": "Except for our degenerate corner cases we hardly encounter such objects in practice. [citation needed: last time I measured was some time ago]\n\nCases:\n- If we have few in-construction objects then the separate data structure keeps complexity where it is (in construction objects).\n- If we have many such in-construction objects, then the query becomes an issue because we have linear complexity for Contains().\n\nMoving over to a processable worklist is a bit slower with just having a std::unordered_set at the same time, we initially do not need to care about segments.\n\nI\u0027d generally say that we should go with the side data structure unless we have data showing otherwise to avoid blowing up Worklist.",
