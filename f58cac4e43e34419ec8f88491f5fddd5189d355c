      "message": "My commit message wasn\u0027t clear, I\u0027ve updated it - the check introduced here is common to all atomic operations, so wait/notify will not fail to validate. The DCHECKS that check for SABs are in callbacks, so depending on the usage this may hit DCHECKS when run - I\u0027m working on a follow up to refactor the Wasm/JS parts to be separate so JS can still retain the DCHECKS and Wasm does not. Added tests here for Wait/Notify here that will pass on validation.",
