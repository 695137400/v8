      "message": "Well, the explanation is really that I added this value a few days ago (and the whole enum a week ago), and it\u0027s only been for our analysis, so I strongly doubt that this is used by anyone (and if anyone did use it, they shouldn\u0027t have, because it\u0027s not the right state for them). I can keep it as is, or have a kNoCacheBecauseExtension \u003d kNoCacheBecauseV8Extension deprecation path, but it feels like overkill. I can if you feel strongly about it though.",
