      "message": "As far as I understand this function is only called on the scope that we\u0027re compiling (during AllocateVariables). And we\u0027re only resolving private name references that weren\u0027t able to resolve for any of the classes we\u0027ve parsed ourselves; and it will resolve in outer scopes. Those scopes are already entirely context allocated, so the class var is deserialized from ScopeInfo and is already set to is_used and ForcedContextAllocated etc?\n\nCan we drop everything in this branch except proxy-\u003eBindTo(var)?\n\nAt the same time we can *only* get errors in the branch above if we\u0027re actually parsing top-level code, in which case we\u0027ll immediately fail if there\u0027s *any* unresolved private variable left? So I presume we could turn that into a CHECK if we\u0027re not on top-level?",
