      "message": "Suggestion (can be a followup CL): Could we use also check the simulator has this feature enabled. What do you think of moving SimulatorFeaturesFromCommandLine to base/cpu.cc and adding the features to the CPU object if we are running on a simulator based on the simulator flags? If we did this we would only need to check cpu.has_jscvt here. Could we do this for Arm too?",
