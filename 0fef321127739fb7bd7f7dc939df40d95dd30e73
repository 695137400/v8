You should be able to flush this out locally by placing an explicit GC call into the constructor implementation. Just for local debugging ...\n\nisolate-\u003eheap()-\u003eCollectAllAvailableGarbage(kTesting);\n\nThe GC-stress bots will also flush this out eventually, but only flakeily.\n\nI would vote for keeping these {VerifyObjectField} instead, this is the common approach we take for all the other objects. The verification methods here only check object graph consistency.\n\nSorry for not spotting this earlier in my previous review.",

It is good to avoid mixing raw pointers and handles to avoid confusion about whether the implementation is handlified or not.",
