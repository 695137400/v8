      "message": "PTAL, unfortunately I was only able to reproduce the crasher while running `v8_inspector_fuzzer` and I was unable to extract a reproduction case that would also work with `inspector-test` (for adding a regression test). I am not sure if this is due to the slight differences between the fuzzer and the test runner binaries, or if the fuzzer also modified the test harness (all the \"InspectorTest.*\" methods). Any advice?",

      "message": "LGTM on the fix. I will look into why the test does not reproduce on inspector-test. For now, you could also add this as a fuzzer regression test (in test/fuzzer/inspector). But ideally the same test would also just run in inspector-test.\n\nMy Linux machine is currently frozen, but I will try to look into that tomorrow.",
