      "message": "This is mostly identical code to the generic write barrier above. I can reuse most of the implementation though (see interface-descriptors-inl.h), so it\u0027s not too much copy+paste.\nInstead of adding this, I also tried encoding the tag into the top bits of the slot pointer. That works, but feels a little hacky. You can see it here: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/4827602/15/src/codegen/x64/macro-assembler-x64.cc\nIt still requires a scratch register and some ORing/ANDing, and it\u0027s probably not worth the reduced register count since these write barriers are fairly rare.",
