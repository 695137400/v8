      "message": "I think that could cause a data race when called from a background thread (the race is on isolate-\u003ethread_id() since the main thread can be migrated between threads). So we can\u0027t use `!Heap::IsMainThread()` to check whether we are on the background thread without a race. We can only assert that we are on the main thread. That\u0027s why I would actually prefer AssertMainThread() here.",
