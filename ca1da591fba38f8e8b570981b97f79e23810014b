I thought it was a \"not ready to merge yet\" flag...\nI didn\u0027t get a mail for your comment either.\n\nAdnreas and me had some discussion about this.\nIt\u0027s a follow-up to https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/3976515 as Andreas wasn\u0027t very happy about the fix.\nMy issue with this WIP change is that I don\u0027t believe that it works in all scenarios and it\u0027s hard to verify / test...\nBecause of that I\u0027ll close this CL now. If anybody fancies picking this up, please go ahead.",

      "message": "This changes the following behaviors:\n1) If the Isolate gets removed in `RemoveIsolate`, we don\u0027t cancel this task? How do we prevent the possibility of the `IsolateInfo` to be destroyed and therefore the `DeregisterTask()` to access invalid memory?\n2) if the `LogCodesTask` would be canceled (how can that happen?), we don\u0027t flip the `has_log_task_scheduled` flag. So in that case the `WasmEngine` would still assume that there is a `LogCodesTask` scheduled even though it isn\u0027t.\n3) It is assumed that the `LogCodesTask` and `RemoveIsolate` are only happening on the JS main thread. Is this guaranteed? Otherwise we\u0027d need some synchronization when accessing the flag. As `Isolate::Deinit` gets called indirectly from `Shell::OnExit` which I assume wouldn\u0027t run on the JS main thread, I don\u0027t think, we are safe without synchronization.",
