      "message": "By changing this the operand goes from unsigned (i.e., 0-255 for a single byte), to signed (0-127 for valid slots) which means we will more often have to scale up the bytecode (i.e., to 16bit or 32bit bytecodes). This will probably have a significant impact on bytecode memory usage in the normal cases, since this would impact all CreateObjectLiteral operations, not just those in one-shot code.\n\nCould we do something else? Presumably we shouldn\u0027t be building boilerplates for one-shot object literals either? Would it make more sense to do something similar to your previous CL and explicitly call a runtime function to create the object literal rather than calling the feedback collecting bytecode handler?",
