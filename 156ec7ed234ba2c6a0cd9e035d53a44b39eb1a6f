      "message": "Sorry, we are going in circles. I should have been more clear. I commented before that we should check the full 16 bytes at `DST_OFFSET` for the expected value, and then I commented that this should happen after every invocation (i.e. in the loop). Now we are doing it in the loop again, but only checking a single location each time, i.e. the first requirement is not met.\n\nTo be more concrete: We could have an `expected_values` array, which is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` initially, and in each iteration we update one slot and then check that the `buffer_view` contains those four values at `DST_OFFSET` (if that\u0027s the intended behavior).\nI think we can drop the check for `SRC_OFFSET`, that seems redundant.\n\nThe same applies in the loop below, of course.",
