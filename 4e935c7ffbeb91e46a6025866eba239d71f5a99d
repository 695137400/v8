      "message": "Hi All, I\u0027m working on enable PKU for v8 heap, but now I meet a problem in this initialization.\nIf we initialize PKU here, is was after we create worker threads(threads are created in `v8::platform::NewDefaultPlatform`), so the worker thread may get the `kNoAccess` permission, which will potentially cause segment fault.\nHence I suppose moving the initiazation into `v8::platform::NewDefaultPlatform`, which will also need we put `int memory_protection_key_` and some APIs in base:: layer.\nIs it suitable to do this?",
