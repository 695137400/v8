      "message": "I am not entirely sure why we need to set_code here. I can\u0027t think of any reason why we should. We only do this when disposing compilation jobs with Flush (basically a GC under memory pressure or debugger) so may not be a problem for now but I am also unsure why we need it here. With mid-tier pipeline this may not be the right thing to do always if we have optimized code from a lower tier. I will drop this unless I am missing something and we need it for some reason.",
