I didn\u0027t know about this issue at all, sorry for introducing the warning.\n\nWhen you say \"temporary\", does that mean we could use some standard C++ way to let the compiler know the `dst` argument of memcpy is not null? From the issue you\u0027ve linked I see that GCC has a nonnull attribute and also there\u0027s gsl::not_null, but I don\u0027t think we can use any of those.\n\nBtw, +1 from me since Nico is mostly OOO today, but please feel free to wait for him too.",
