      "message": "\u003e Is this addressing the same issue that I was attempting to address by erasing the continuation information attached to the else_statement and then_statement of an IfStatement?\n\nNot sure what that issue was :) What I\u0027m addressing here is that some language constructs create two nested ranges with identical start and end points. This confuses post-processing later, especially if the range\u0027s continuation counts differ.\n\n\u003e continuation_positions_.find(continuation.start) !\u003d continuation_positions_.end()\n\u003e \n\u003e ☝ this is saying that the first range that starts at a position takes precedence? I think this addresses the then_statement, but will it address the source map range associated with an else_statement, which I would think starts at a position later than the IfStatement/then_statement.\n\nThe visitor visits in pre-order, so parent ranges will always be processed before child ranges. Here we only care about continuation ranges with identical start positions, so afaik the else_statement range isn\u0027t problematic.",
