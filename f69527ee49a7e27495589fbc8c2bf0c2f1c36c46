      "message": "Sounds good. Would it be best to delete this entire deprecated-methods test too, or just leave the `var deprecatedMethods` array empty so we can add to it later perhaps in the future?\n\nAlso...any ideas on the consistent linux_trusty_blink_rel bot failure?",

      "message": "You can remove this test all together and maybe all related to deprecation warning logic from v8-console.cc if nobody else uses it.\nYou need to build chromium with your CL applied to src/v8 and check what tests are failing, or you can find this information on try bot: there is link to \"layout_test_results\":\nhttps://test-results.appspot.com/data/layout_results/linux_trusty_blink_rel/30544/layout-test-results/results.html\n\nPart of failing tests can be removed as well, part of them looks suspicious. To land your CL:\n- prepare tests on chromium side by running them with your V8 CL - update tests and expectations,\n- mark tests as [SKIP] or at least [NEEDSMANUALREBASELINE] in TestExpectations file:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests/TestExpectations?q\u003dTestExpectation+%22%5B+SKIP%22\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026dr\u003dC\u0026l\u003d41\n- land preparation CL,\n- land this V8 CL,\n- after 2-4 days enable tests on chromium side.",
