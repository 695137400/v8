      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is right - it looks like this is unconditionally lowering here whether the function has SIMD or not. What you actually want is to tag has_simd_ correctly where parameters are being evaluated. Otherwise this is called twice (once in BuildGraphForWasmFunction, and here) and traverses the entire graph. If has_simd_ is correctly populated on S128 parameters, you wouldn\u0027t need this.",
