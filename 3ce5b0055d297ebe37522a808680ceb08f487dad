      "message": "I don\u0027t feel strongly, but I think my reluctance is related to the fact that we already have both of these types spread out throughout the codebase, so having TemplateLiteral::StringList makes me think that it\u0027s something \"special\", rather than just another ZoneList\u003cconst AstRawString*\u003e.\n\nThere\u0027s actually a whole separate conversation about whether we should be using ZoneVector for these things nowadays...but that\u0027s rather orthogonal.",
