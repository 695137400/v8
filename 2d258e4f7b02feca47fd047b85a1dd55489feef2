      "message": "Hey Yang, Leszek,\n\nI found the core issue with generators in the debugger (wrt. breakpoint behavior): It\u0027s the internal `Return`s generated from `yields` (including the implicit initial yield). After two failed attempts I realized that it\u0027s best to not put any source positions onto those `Return`s, and in fact that turned out to be the most elegant solution. \n\nPlease take a look.\n\nthanks,\nBenedikt",
