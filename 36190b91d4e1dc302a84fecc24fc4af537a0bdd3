      "message": "By calling this here, we create the script context before the function runs. The side-effect check happens from Runtime_DebugOnFunctionCall which only runs once the function is called.\n\nThis means if you do debug-eval(\"const y \u003d 1\") with throwOnSideEffect: true, it throws with a side-effect which is correct, but the next time you do debug-eval(\"const y \u003d 1\") with throwOnSideEffect: false, you get \"SyntaxError: Identifier \u0027y\u0027 has already been declared\". You get the same thing even with throwOnSideEffect: true as well, even though it should be throwing because of a side-effect, not a name clash",
