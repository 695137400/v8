This provides no benefit over simply ignoring the return value of JSReceiver::DefineOwnProperty, as it expands to (semantically) \"if (failure) { return undefined; } else { return undefined; }\".\nMaybe what you want is a DCHECK that the operation was successful, along with a USE to stop release builds from complaining about an unused variable:\n\n  Maybe\u003cbool\u003e success \u003d JSReceiver::DefineOwnProperty(...);\n  DCHECK(success.IsJust() \u0026\u0026 success.FromJust());\n  USE(success);",
