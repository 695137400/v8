      "message": "In general this LGTM, however we also need to teach Heap::FreeSharedLinearAllocationAreas that background threads can have shared LABs as well (iterate through all LocalHeaps like Heap::MakeHeapIterable). Without this, shared GCs might crash randomly when performing allocations on background threads.  We should be able to land this CL as-is though, as long as we don\u0027t use that in any test yet.\n\nLet me know whether you need help here and/or whether I should add the handling of shared LABs in a subsequent CL. I knew that we didn\u0027t support this atm but didn\u0027t think it was necessary for now..",
