      "message": "In MachineOptimizationReducer::ReduceComparison (machine-optimization-reducer.h line 1193), foldable comparisons were performed on 64-bit rather than 32-bit. My initial fix was to add a cast there (something like `if (rep \u003d\u003d Word32) { k1 \u003d static_cast\u003cint32_t\u003e(k1); k2 \u003d static_cast\u003cint32_t\u003e(k2); }`.\nBut I actually think that it\u0027s more the responsability of MatchWordConstant to return 32-bit values when `rep` is Word32.",
