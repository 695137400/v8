I don\u0027t think I want to make compiler folks unhappy. :)\n\nHandling in CSA builtin works fine, but the problem is that I\u0027d have to triplicate that check in the three stubs (currently the check is in the main builtin before it defers to the three stubs). I guess that\u0027s still better than the other options, so I\u0027ll look into that.",
