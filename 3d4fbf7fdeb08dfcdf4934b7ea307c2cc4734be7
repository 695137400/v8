      "message": "Did you consider different solutions that avoid the addtl Map class? This feels pretty awkward to me, esp. compared with the previous solution which was just \n\n  V(kLayoutDescriptorOffset, FLAG_unbox_double_fields ? kTaggedSize : 0)    \\\n\nFor example, what about emulating current behavior by adding Torque syntax for conditional fields? Or using a dedicated type just for layout_descriptor that is size 0 if the flag is unset? Or, not sure if/when this will happen, wait until double-unboxing is removed when pointer compression ships?",
