      "message": "Did you consider different solutions that avoid the addtl Map class? This feels pretty awkward to me, esp. compared with the previous solution which was just \n\n  V(kLayoutDescriptorOffset, FLAG_unbox_double_fields ? kTaggedSize : 0)    \\\n\nFor example, what about emulating current behavior by adding Torque syntax for conditional fields? Or using a dedicated type just for layout_descriptor that is size 0 if the flag is unset? Or, not sure if/when this will happen, wait until double-unboxing is removed when pointer compression ships?",

      "message": "Given that we will not have maps with and without the descriptor field at the same time it would be much cleaner to keep having only one definition of the Map class. Let us discuss what we can do on Torque side to make it possible.\n\nAnyway, I think it would be better if we define Map as typedef to either MapWithLayoutDescriptor or MapWithoutLayoutDescriptor otherwise it really causes confusion on runtime side.",
