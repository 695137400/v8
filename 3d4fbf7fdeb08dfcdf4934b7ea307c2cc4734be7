      "message": "Good point. I didn\u0027t realize there were cases like Code with larger padding. I think there\u0027s still a need for this behavior where we pad to the required alignment for the following field, but we\u0027ll eventually need to extend the syntax so we can specify a different alignment size for the Code case.",

      "message": "Did you consider different solutions that avoid the addtl Map class? This feels pretty awkward to me, esp. compared with the previous solution which was just \n\n  V(kLayoutDescriptorOffset, FLAG_unbox_double_fields ? kTaggedSize : 0)    \\\n\nFor example, what about emulating current behavior by adding Torque syntax for conditional fields? Or using a dedicated type just for layout_descriptor that is size 0 if the flag is unset? Or, not sure if/when this will happen, wait until double-unboxing is removed when pointer compression ships?",

      "message": "I\u0027m somewhat relieved that you and Igor find this pattern uncomfortable too. I expressed similar concerns in an email to Daniel a few weeks back:\n\n\u003e Iâ€™m a little bit hesitant about that approach: it turns Map::kSize into a footgun, it complicates Map::BodyDescriptor because pointer fields are split across Map and a subclass, and it scatters a handful of new casts throughout the code. None of these things are terrible, but all together they feel kind of inelegant compared to the current representation of Map as a single class.\n\nIgor\u0027s suggestion of typedefing Map to either MapWithLayoutDescriptor or MapWithoutLayoutDescriptor would alleviate most of the ugliness in the runtime code, but it would still be nicer to define a single Torque class. To summarize the options I\u0027ve heard so far (and there are probably others):\n\n1. Use the C preprocessor. I like this option for its instantly familiar syntax, and it\u0027s powerful enough that we may find other uses for it too.\n2. Add new Torque syntax that decorates a field type as optional based on a flag.\n3. Use a special type (LayoutDescriptorIfUnboxDoubleFields?), that is known to the compiler to mean \"LayoutDescriptor or empty, depending on FLAG_unbox_double_fields\". This keeps the Torque syntax as simple as possible, but at the cost of putting some additional knowledge about the program being compiled into the compiler itself.\n\nWith options 1 and 2, we need to specify a list of values (such as FLAG_unbox_double_fields) that should be available at Torque compilation time. We wouldn\u0027t want to pass the original cflags and duplicate a bunch of logic from build-config.h and globals.h. Seems like we could just put this list in a .cc file and include it in the compiled torque executable.\n\nWhich solution would you prefer?",

Let us discuss what we can do on Torque side to make it possible.\n\nAnyway, I think it would be better if we define Map as typedef to either MapWithLayoutDescriptor or MapWithoutLayoutDescriptor otherwise it really causes confusion on runtime side.",
