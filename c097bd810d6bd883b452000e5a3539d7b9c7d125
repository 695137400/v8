      "message": "As discussed: the problem with jumping to \"return_result\" directly is that \"TryGetOwnProperty\" doesn\u0027t handle all cases. Simply skipping over the checking of {trap_result} in those cases would be incorrect. The best fix is probably to create a runtime function that takes over at exactly the right point in the control flow (as opposed to restarting the entire operation like Runtime::kGetOwnPropertyWithReceiver does).",
