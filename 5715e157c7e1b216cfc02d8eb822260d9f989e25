      "message": "I just picked the lowest power of 10 that still gave the same merge result for v8:14133, so this is not an exact science. For reference, other choices:\n- `kMaxRetries \u003d 100` gives `1101` merged spill ranges (instead of the optimal 989, so it degrades somewhat gracefully, not like a hard threshold) and `V8.TFAssignSpillSlots` takes ~50ms. I think this is too aggressive, as `kMaxRetries \u003d 1000` is fast enough and doesn\u0027t degrade code quality.\n- `kMaxRetries \u003d 10000` gives `989` merged spill ranges (so optimal) and `V8.TFAssignSpillSlots` takes ~470ms. This could be a more conservative choice.\n\nWDYT?",
