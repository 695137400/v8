      "message": "Unfortunately this CL could not land because of two failing tests. Sweeping finalization occurred in a young GC cycle that interrupted a full GC cycle, because of `Sweeper::PauseOrCompleteScope` inside `ScavengerCollector::ColelctGarbage`.\n\nPatchset #5 changes the above to only pause sweeping, not complete it. It should have been completed in `Heap::CompleteSweepingYoung` before getting to this. If we\u0027re so unlucky and sweeping finished after that, let\u0027s just pause it.\n\nI also added a couple of `DCHECK`s.",
