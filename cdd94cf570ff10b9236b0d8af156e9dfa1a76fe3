      "message": "What I\u0027m suggesting here is the equivalent of your option 2 from the other comment; I\u0027d just move it down a little to the case !GetSimpleTransition().is_null() since that\u0027s the only case were we have an existing transition already.\n\nNote that we don\u0027t really need to do a search, we can reuse the check from line 108 as I mentioned. Basically you can extend the check at line 122 to also check whether GetSimpleTransitionKey(simple_transition) !\u003d *name || GetTargetDetails(*name, *target).attributes() !\u003d GetSimpleTransitionDetails(...).attributes()",
