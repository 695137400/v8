On Windows e.g. SuspendThread() is async too, but there\u0027s no way to know when it actually suspends, so we just get more-or-less the right thread state.\n\n(Mostly I don\u0027t know where this sampler is used and if it\u0027s a good idea to be blocking or not. Perhaps just a comment that this might be worth measuring and/or removing.)",
