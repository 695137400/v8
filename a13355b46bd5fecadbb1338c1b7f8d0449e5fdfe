      "message": "I think I understand now why you added this method (verifying young gen marking should only count the bytes marked by the young gen gc).\nHowever, would it not be easier to let the marking verifier verify old objects as well? Verification will take longer, but this is an expensive step anyway that is not run in production. If the verifier counts all objects, you could just return `marked_bytes_so_far_` which will make this method redundant, and would simplify the verifier (since it no longer needs to take collection type into account).\nWdyt?",
