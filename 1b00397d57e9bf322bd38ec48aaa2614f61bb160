      "message": "Hey! FYI, I\u0027ve started a JetStream2 pinpoint for this CL, because Turbofan is more used there (https://pinpoint-dot-chromeperf.appspot.com/job/1520e73c210000).\n\nThat being said, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the impact of this CL is too small to show up on JetStream/Speedometer. Turbofan compile time might change a little bit, but to see it, you\u0027ll probably need to run V8 locally with --turbo-stats. I can take care of running this if you want, let me know ;-)",
