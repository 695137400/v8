      "message": "While the examples in this file aren\u0027t security-relevant because they\u0027re not production code, they illustrate the problem that caused me to decide to drop these helper functions: from this code, it\u0027s not obvious that `exp_fun-\u003einstance_data()` and `exp_fun-\u003efunction_index()` both dereference the `exp_fun-\u003eshared()-\u003ewasm_exported_function_data()` links internally, and could hence return inconsistent values if some concurrent modification happened right between the two calls.\nPut differently, depending on Clang\u0027s LoadElimination decisions, the old code _might_ have been fine, but I\u0027d rather not have V8 security depend on invisible (and optional) compiler optimization decisions :-)\nWhile the new version is slightly more verbose, it is (1) more explicit and (2) guaranteed to not repeat unnecessary memory loads, thereby possibly providing a tiny speed improvement.",
