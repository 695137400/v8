      "message": "The main problem with `const char[N]` is that the length is part of the type, which makes it much more difficult (or impossible?) to declare a template that receives several static strings of different lengths. We could just go with `const char[]`, and compute the length using another constexpr function (or using `std::string_view{str}.size()`, which is also constexpr). But then again it would be tricky to initialize those arrays. `std::string_view` is just much nicer to work with, because they allow for copy initialization (just like `std::array`), and the length is part of the value and not the type.",
