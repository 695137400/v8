      "message": "Was a bit concerned about what happens if the OSR optimized code is collected after being reported to the sampler but it looks like it will get cleaned up in CodeMap::ClearCodesInRange called from AddCode and MoveCode. I guess that\u0027s generally the way the profiler deals with collected code -- it\u0027s not a problem unless part of its location gets reused and if/when it does,its CodeMap entry is iced. Couldn\u0027t spot any test cases for this but I could see it would be challenging to build such a test.\n\nSo lgtm FWIW (thanks for the cc).",
