      "message": "This was a performance optimisation more than code size. The compiler just compiled faster as well. We want these calls to be as fast as possible; wrapping around it in the baseline compiler was simply a way of not just doing what the macro-assembler did, which was slower than the code here. Direct rip-relative is faster; and that\u0027s exactly what Igor was investigating :) rip-relative calls shouldn\u0027t be bigger than RootRegister-indexing indirect calls.",
