There was a merge conflict and git pull was showing my local as up to date so I deleted the old one and downloaded a fresh clone.\n\nThis is my first time contributing to V8 so I hope that I\u0027ve done everything right and let me know if there\u0027s anything else that I need to do. You were the person that was suggested as an Owner by git cl owners, but if it would be better to send it to someone else then let me know.\n\nThis is not a complete fix to the relevant Issues but it is an improvement and combined with another type of fix laid out in the change description it could potentially suffice to consider the Issues solved.\n\nThanks,\nEmber",
