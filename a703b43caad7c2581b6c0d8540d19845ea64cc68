      "message": "It looks a bit hacky to me that this function can now have the side effect of reporting an error but that it may also return false without having reported an error. At least I would expect a comment about it, maybe even at the call site in Scan(). But I\u0027m not really familiar with the scanner, so I\u0027d like vogelheim@ to decide.\n\nOther than that I\u0027m happy with the CL.",

      "message": "Thanks for pointing that out. This is a bit weird, but given that the error handling in the scanner is rather ad-hoc anyhow I don\u0027t see an obviously better way.\n\nA bool is kinda the wrong return type, since this is really a three-state thing: success, no whitespace, and error.\nOther functions use a Token \u0026 Token::ILLEGAL for error handling, but there is no token for the \u0027no whitespace\u0027 case either.\nI\u0027m mostly undecided here, but I guess I\u0027d prefer to leave this as-is until I actually have a better idea of how to handle this systematically.",
