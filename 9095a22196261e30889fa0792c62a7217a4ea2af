      "message": "This CL is a WIP right now because of this line. To go from `Local` to a normal (indirect) `Handle`, we need to get the isolate. In the past, I\u0027ve been doing this by getting the current thread\u0027s isolate, but since rebasing this onto the latest main branch this causes a linker error as it can\u0027t find the thread_local `v8::internal::g_current_isolate_` symbol.\n\nBefore I go about trying to debug this I first should ask is this even correct? Is there a proper way here to get the isolate? I thought about `IsolateFromNeverReadOnlySpaceObject` but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s correct as Locals can point to read-only space.",
