      "message": "Thanks for the CL. This is quite a lot of special casing for CFI, I think we should probably discuss the reasoning and pros/cons of this at the Arm sync next week, would that be possible?  Do you have any performance numbers on how much this impacts performance on CFI/non-CFI builds?\n\nGeorg / Michael - do you know if Intel\u0027s CFI approach will have similar overheads on interpreter bytecode dispatch tail-calls? If so I\u0027d like to make sure we design something that works on all architectures.",
