      "message": "Tobias, I\u0027m not sure if I found the right balance of converting current, untyped code to TNodes.  If I try to type IsIntPtrDiv, this spiders out to the existing node-test-utils testing infrastructure.\nIs there a better way to cast or avoid this casting?\nThanks.",

      "message": "Avoiding the casts is a bit difficult, without changing gmock. I would recommend to just use Node* everywhere here to keep it simple and consistent. I don\u0027t think there is too much of a point in typing the tests, although it\u0027s a pity :)",

      "message": "Since I removed the IntPtrDiv method that accepted SloppyTNodes (only accepts TNode\u003cIntPtr\u003e now), it\u0027s bit more work to make all these untyped Nodes and have to unchecked cast it back to an IntPtrT node.  So I\u0027ll just stick with these few unsightly TNode -\u003e Node* casts, if that\u0027s okay.\nThanks.",
