      "message": "We certainly can, but Torque doesn\u0027t know that `invalid` is a special value and that kFlagCount should actually be one less than the total number of flags. I guess we could have Torque put a kInvalid on the end of every set of flags it generates, or invent some new syntax to indicate that a bitfield should not affect the generated kFlagCount (@uncounted?), but I\u0027m worried that those ideas might cause more problems than they solve. What about just adding a comment in the tq file, like this?\n\n  invalid: bool: 1 bit;  // Must be last.",
