      "message": "I\u0027d like this to be more robust, especially now that the flag definition is split from the kFlagCount constant. Adding/removing a flag should automatically update the count. Could we have torque auto-generate a `count` constant for all flag defs?",

      "message": "We certainly can, but Torque doesn\u0027t know that `invalid` is a special value and that kFlagCount should actually be one less than the total number of flags. I guess we could have Torque put a kInvalid on the end of every set of flags it generates, or invent some new syntax to indicate that a bitfield should not affect the generated kFlagCount (@uncounted?), but I\u0027m worried that those ideas might cause more problems than they solve. What about just adding a comment in the tq file, like this?\n\n  invalid: bool: 1 bit;  // Must be last.",

      "message": "Are you saying torque-generated flags already have a way to get the count? If so, what about removing invalid from the enum value set and adding it here in C++ as \n\n STATIC_ASSERT(Flags::Count \u003c 32);\n static constexpr int kInvalidFlag \u003d 1 \u003c\u003c Flags::Count // or whatever the way to get the flag count is\n\nThen the torque definition would contain all real enum values, the count would be correct, and kInvalid would always be a bit not included in the real set. If easy to do, I propose this way for the current CL.\n\nAlternatively we could refactor JSRegExp::FlagFromChar to communicate the error case using a bool or a Maybe value and get rid of kInvalid altogether (it\u0027s only used during parsing). A follow-up would be fine for this.\n\nWdyt?",

      "message": "Defining kInvalidFlag as a static constexpr int means we need some ugly casts in places where we expect a value of type JSRegExp::Flag. I like the idea of just getting rid of kInvalidFlag entirely; that seems like a nice simplification, and makes clear our expectation that the invalid flag is never actually set in an instance of JSRegExp. The only thing we lose is a clever optimization in JSRegExp::FlagsFromString where we could check for duplicate and invalid flags simultaneously, but I doubt that one extra branch in that function would cause any noticeable slowdown.",
