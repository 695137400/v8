      "message": "Hi Stephan,\n\nThank you for your contribution! I\u0027d suggest filing a bug on https://crbug.com/v8/ with a slightly more detailed explanation why this template specialization is needed, and then adding \"Bug: v8:NNN\" to the CL description. Otherwise the change looks good to me, I\u0027ll wait for the tryjobs to finish to +1 it.\n",
