      "message": "Just FYI that while your approach is similar to what others are doing here (e.g. Skia), there will be chunks of time where the new branch is basically N/A (whenever stable \u003d\u003d extended), and at some point (e.g. if other long-lived branches launch) it feels like migrating away from \"beta\" and \"stable\" and towards milestone and branch-based names might be more convenient.  This is the direction the security team is starting to move, and Chrome as a whole will need to move eventually IMO.  Just wanted to provide a pointer to the future so it\u0027s not a surprise later.",
