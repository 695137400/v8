      "message": "Note that I didn\u0027t write any explicit test cases for all the special cases in these functions and just ported the functions that were running into an `UNIMPLEMENTED` with all their special cases.\nIt seems tough to write test cases for it. E.g. for this loop it doesn\u0027t seem trivial as this pattern also seems to be optimized by Turboshaft. This could mean that it isn\u0027t even required in the intruction selection any more (and possibly not even in Turbofan) but it\u0027s hard to prove that, too.\n\nI could copy the already working cases from basic.js to instruction-selection.js temporarily but that isn\u0027t nice either.",
