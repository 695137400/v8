      "message": "I like that we now test everything one synchronous and once asynchronous, but this creates a lot of code duplication (like this ffi object).\nCan we create a new helper function which tests both paths (sync and async) and checks the same things on the result? The interface would probably look similar to assertPromiseResult, instead that it receives a builder as first argument. It then checks the synchronous case manually and calls assertPromiseResult to test the asynchronous part.",
