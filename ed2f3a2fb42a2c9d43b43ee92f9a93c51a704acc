      "message": "three is the charm...\nPTAL, Patchset1 is identical to the last try. What makes this try better: (1) I fixed two more places with missing checks. (2) I don\u0027t remove the code that keeps the r/o markbits black. That should have gone into the second CL :( Keeping it in this CL caused segv for all the cases I missed, because the marker tried to mark R/O objects (where the markbits are write protected).",
