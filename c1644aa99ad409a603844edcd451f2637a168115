      "message": "I can confirm it fixed the issue in our repro (George built chromium for me with this patch and I tested it with a OnePlus9 phone running AOSP).\n\nLooking at the other compilers, I think sparkplug has exactly the same bug, would be it worth fixing it as well preemptively? I think the maglev code is OK. https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/baseline/arm64/baseline-assembler-arm64-inl.h;l\u003d613\n\nOtherwise LGTM!",
