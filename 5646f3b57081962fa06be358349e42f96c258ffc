      "message": "Mhm, good question. I just now played locally with the idea (adding a `needs_variables_` field on `Block`).\nIt reduces code size further and gives another 1% reduction in total compile time, so that\u0027s great.\nOn the other hand, it feels a bit dirty, because now every Block carries around that field, even though only this copy phase needs it. And I need to mutate the `input_block` through a `const` pointer (in order to update the field), which is less than ideal.\nI\u0027ll upload that version in a bit and let\u0027s discuss further how we could clean this up.",
