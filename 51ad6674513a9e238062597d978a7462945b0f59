      "message": "This change is because prior to this CL, even though `i::Module::kEvaluatingAsync` existed, it wasn\u0027t used. Instead, `i::Module::kEvaluated` was used everywhere as a stand-in for `i::Module::kEvaluatingAsync` together with checking if the module had an async evaluation ordinal.\n\nThis CL started using `i::Module::kEvaluatingAsync`, so without breaking back compat for embedders, we need to map it to `v8::Module::kEvaluated`. Ideally, we would expose `v8::Module::kEvaluatingAsync` but I\u0027m leaving that as a follow up because I don\u0027t actually know how to go about changing an API enum.",
