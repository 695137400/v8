Only for large pages we would actually need the more expensive `upper_bound` search.\nIn the new version we use `upper_bound` for all pages, which could slow down CSS.\nUnfortunately we don\u0027t currently have a way to continuously track CSS performance.\n\nCC\u0027ing Nikos (who implemented the ToT version and is working on CSS) for FYI.",
