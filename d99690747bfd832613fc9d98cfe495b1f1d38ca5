      "message": "Michi pointed out that the deopting version should be as fast as the throwing version (unless we are in try catch block). I tried to measure this on ARES/Air and there it indeed does not make difference.\n\nDo you know a workload where it would make difference? If not, perhaps we can remove the protector and this function?",

      "message": "I was also thinking about ARES/Air. I tried to measure it locally, on the averageWorstCase mean there seems to be a slight improvement with this. Without this the averageWorstCase ranges from 45-47ms and with this change it is in the range 44-46ms. That is kind of 2% improvement. It is a bit noisy and I ran it only about 7-8 times. \n\nSince, there seems to be a slight improvement how about landing this and then removing the Deopt version as a separate cl. If there are any regressions on the bots we could revert it.",

      "message": "In the compiled code, there should not be any difference between throwing and deopting (unless the throwing is inside a try-catch). The only differences I can think of is compile time, but I think ARES does not compile very much now.\n\nNormally, I think it is better to start with a simpler version and then try out more complex alternatives, but I am fine with committing this and then trying to simplify.",
