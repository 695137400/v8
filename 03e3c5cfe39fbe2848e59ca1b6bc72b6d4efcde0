I test that the callback is not called immediately but I can\u0027t check that it\u0027s called later without pumping the message loop somehow. If you know of a way to pump the message loop from a unittest please let me know because I couldn\u0027t find any.\nI can override the platform just for this tests and provide an implementation that gives me a manual pump method, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth it.",
