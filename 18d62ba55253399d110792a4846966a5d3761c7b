      "message": "As far as I understand, this CL allocates the whole signature object including types array in one allocation, whereas the original code with the Signature::Builder uses two allocations. Nice find! One question though: Could you not just have done this refactoring in the Signature::Builder, so that all uses of Signature::Builder benefit from the change? The Signature::Builder seems to be a nice design pattern, and not inherently the issue here. As far as I understand the code, it is not necessary to inline the builder code in the CallDescriptor code manually.\n\nThe other small cleanups are naturally nice though.",

      "message": "This CL specifically avoids the use of `Signature::Builder`, since it\u0027s an unnecessary abstraction which does not improve readability here IMO. There is also a chance that writing to the array directly is faster, but I did not measure that specifically.\n\nI can look into applying the same optimization to `Signature::Builder`, but I think that\u0027s independent of this CL.",
