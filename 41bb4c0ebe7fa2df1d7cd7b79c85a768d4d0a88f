      "message": "This is a much-simplified version of the logic in SetInitializerContextIfNeeded. I explain below why there\u0027s no need to handle the BINDING case; as for the code that checked whether the AstNode to be visited next was an Assignment, that was not necessary for proper operation. Now that it\u0027s gone, \"ASSIGNMENT_ELEMENT\" seemed a better name for the context than \"ASSIGNMENT_INITIALIZER\".",
