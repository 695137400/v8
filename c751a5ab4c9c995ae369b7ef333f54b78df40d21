There\u0027s still code in Chromium that seems to be attempting to do the copying behavior of old:\n\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/blink/renderer/core/typed_arrays/dom_array_buffer.cc;drc\u003dae1a631ceaf488f5e9cb55755de32b6a505b4b1e;l\u003d45\n\ndo you understand why that\u0027s not working?\n\nI\u0027d like to see a Chromium-side web_test (hopefully web platform test that can be shared upstream) for this behavior as well, to make sure this does what we expect when integrated (obviously that\u0027d be a separate CL from this one.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not so surprised that this is a V8-only thing. This is a WebAssembly-only issue, and ArrayBuffers on the blink side don\u0027t have knowledge about whether they belong to WebAssembly or not. It is fine to post-message an ArrayBuffer. The sender is just not allowed anymore to use the ArrayBuffer anymore afterwards. However, for WebAssembly memory it is not allowed to postMessage the memory, or the buffer of the memory, if it is not shared. I agree that a web test would be great, but that would not be part of this CL.",
