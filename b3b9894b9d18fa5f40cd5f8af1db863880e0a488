      "message": "We should not disable noexcept if we compile with -fnoexceptions because it is still needed to allow the use of certain optimizations of the standard library. For example, std::vector checks if a element is is_nothrow_move_constructible\u003cT\u003e at certain places to allow optimizations. Even without exceptions an element still does not full fill this requirement.\n\nThere was discussion to add an additional compiler flag to gcc/clang to support default noexcept  but was never added. As far as I know, this was never added because such a flag will cause and ABI break.",
