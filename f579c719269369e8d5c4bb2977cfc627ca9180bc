      "message": "this access is actually a bit funky, since it provides a Handle\u003cStringTable\u003e, not a StringTable. It actually returns a Handle whose backing is that entry in the roots array; and only on Handle deref does it read the string table from that location. So, to make the access \"synchronized\" we\u0027d need a SynchronizedHandle, not just a synchronized accessor.\n\nHowever, in this case it doesn\u0027t matter, since the writes to the string table root entry are guarded by the mutex, so un-synchronized accesses inside the lock are fine. The only interesting part is that the store has to be Release, so that other reads _outside_ the lock can read it.\n\nTechnically, since false-negatives are ok, none of these accesses actually need acq-rel semantics, it just seemed like the right thing to do. Maybe it\u0027s not?",

Given that we are accessing this root value in such a non-trivial way, maybe we should not have handle-returning-getter at all, just to avoid surprises.\nAlthough we are reading behind the lock, I have a gut feeling that TSAN may complain about release stores followed by normal reads.
