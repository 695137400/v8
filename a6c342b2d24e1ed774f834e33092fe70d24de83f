On Microsoft Teams, I ran a few benchmarks on release build of heap snapshots and this V8 API to see the performance difference.\n\nTaking heap snapshots averaged about 22,000 ms (22s)\nThis `CollectAllAvailableGarbage()` call averaged about 500 ms (0.5s)\nIterating the traced handles averaged 1.0 ms (0.001s)\n\nRob\u0027s numbers may vary based on hardware of course :)\n\nTaking a full heap snapshot, and then iterating over them would lose substantial performance compared to this V8 API. I think there is still value to this API to deliver a fast user experience.\n\nI understand maintenance concerns.\nThe garbage collection may not be necessary.
