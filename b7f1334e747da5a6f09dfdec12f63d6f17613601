      "message": "This is the first time that we change reachability from the \"decoder backend\" (i.e. the turbofan graph builder). So far, reachability was completely determined by the backend-independent code in function-body-decoder-impl.h. This will only become relevant once other backends (currently only Liftoff) also implement exception handling, but it would be nice anyway to keep this backend-independent. Do you think that\u0027s easily doable?",

      "message": "Ack. As discussed offline, I share your discomfort with this non-explicit updating of the reachability and was hesitant about it too. However there already is another place where this is done already[1]. That being said, I\u0027ll try to make this dependency more explicit by using an out-parameter in the {CatchException} and {CatchAll} interface method and upload a separate CL for this.\n\n[1] https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/wasm/baseline/liftoff-compiler.cc?type\u003dcs\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026g\u003d0\u0026l\u003d1374",
