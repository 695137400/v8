The trivial parameters like those could just get passed to v8_builder as parameters, right?\n\nAlso the triggering_policy could be passed as param, since we currently don\u0027t overwrite it.\n\nThe properties might need some more massaging:\nThe expression kwargs[\"properties\"] expects a param properties and would fail if such a param doesn\u0027t exist. In this case rather just add a param properties to clusterfuzz_builder?",
