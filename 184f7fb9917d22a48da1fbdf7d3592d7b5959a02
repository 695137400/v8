      "message": "We know that for kUninitialized and kMigrationTarget since the array is empty. We do not know that for kWeakRef though. It could be a PROPERTY_TRANSITION (i.e not a SIMPLE one) which could be found. Then, we could special case for the first two (kWeakRef needs to check).\n\nHowever, we still need to search to fill in the correct insertion_index, which fills in index without overhead. Also, avoiding special casing helps reading from already super special cased method(s).",
