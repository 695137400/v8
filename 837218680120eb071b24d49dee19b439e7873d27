      "message": "The second round of phantom callbacks is allowed to do allocations which can trigger GC. I think we would need to move this phase earlier than Heap::TearDown.\n\nMaybe at the beginning of Isolate::Deinit.\n\nAlso, we would need to make sure that if recursive GCs are triggered they also use synchronous callbacks, no?",

      "message": "I think we cannot trigger recursive GCs since this happens after Heap::StartTearDown which sets the gc state to TEAR_DOWN.\nBetween Heap::StartTearDown and Heap::TearDown, a few other things are torn down (see Isolate::Deinit), so maybe it\u0027s better to move this new code in StartTearDown, after updating the GC state.
