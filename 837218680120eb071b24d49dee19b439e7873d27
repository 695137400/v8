I think we would need to move this phase earlier than Heap::TearDown.\n\nMaybe at the beginning of Isolate::Deinit.\n\nAlso, we would need to make sure that if recursive GCs are triggered they also use synchronous callbacks, no?",

      "message": "The TEAR_DOWN state does not prohibit GC but seems to prevent most task-based helpers from running.\n\nThis is all about callbacks that free stuff when d8 is called with \u0027--invoke-weak-callbacks\u0027, right?\n\nIf we only care about the currently enqueued callbacks and not any potentially triggered followups, then indeed \n\n  1. gc_state_ \u003d TEAR_DOWN\n  2.
