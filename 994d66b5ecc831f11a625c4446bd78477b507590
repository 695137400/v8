      "message": "I\u0027m wondering, does this end up performing a 64-bit or a 32-bit store? The slot in the JSExternalObject is only 32 bits large (the size of an ExternalPointerHandle), but the `MachineType::Pointer()` from the `AccessBuilder::ForJSExternalObjectValue()` should be 64 bit large. Maybe it\u0027s anyway nicer to make this an explicit Uint32 store since we are not storing a pointer, but an ExternalPointerHandle. That might mean that we\u0027d need a separate `AccessBuilder::ForJSExternalObjectExternalPointerHandle()` or something along these lines.",
