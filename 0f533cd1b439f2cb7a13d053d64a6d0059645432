      "message": "The exact size (in bytes) is not what matters; what matters is that it is large enough to get allocated in Large Object Space -- otherwise the test failed to test what it intends to test, and the {kLongLength} constant would have to be chosen differently. I think the \u0027\u003e\u0027 comparison is the best way to express this.\nWe could add a CHECK(Handle\u003cWasmArray\u003e::cast(large_result)-\u003elength() \u003d\u003d kLongLength), but that\u0027s already covered by the kGetLength test above.",
