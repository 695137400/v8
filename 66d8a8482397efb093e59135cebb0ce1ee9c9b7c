In V8 we sometimes have to use them, but these 3-line macros really aren\u0027t worth it: if my counting is correct, you need 8 lines for the macro-ified version (including some pretty ugly formatting in lines 1096/1097; without that it\u0027d be 10 lines), where the expansion would be 9 lines; that\u0027s clearly not worth the repetitiveness savings to make a human reader of the code expand the macro in their head.\n\nSame for the other macros below.\n\n[1] https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Preprocessor_Macros",
