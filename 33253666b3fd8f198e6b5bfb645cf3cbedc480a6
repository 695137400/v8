      "message": "Hi!\n\nHere\u0027s a patch that removes most BTI instructions from baseline code, but only when we disable deopting to baseline code. When looking at the sum of all generated baseline code (using --log-code), I measured a reduction of ~18% when running speedometer2! We did have *many* jump targets.\n\nI also did a pinpoint run, hopefully I set it up correctly, I hadn\u0027t used it before :-) https://pinpoint-dot-chromeperf.appspot.com/job/168b7e6daa0000 \n\nThe results look pretty good, although it\u0027s not that many runs (just 30) so I\u0027m unsure about them. Locally, I benchmarked on a more recent phone with 1xCortex-X1/3xCortex-A78/4xCortex-A55, and saw an overall improvement around 0.4-0.5%.\n\nThis CL doesn\u0027t change the current default however, I thought I\u0027d be conservative. However if the result look good, it\u0027d be great to turn it on, or even make it the default at compile-time.\n\nWDYT?\n\nThanks,\nPierre",
