      "message": "I am not 100% certain but I think `cmpq` is the better option. If both inputs are 32-bit `cmpq` and `cmpl` are identical.\nIf however one of the inputs is 64-bit, we would get unexpected results with `cmpl`. E.g. if you have 32-bit value `less` 64-bit value.\nBut as you wrote the code initially you probably know best. WDYT?",
