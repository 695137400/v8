      "message": "Yeah, I see the output of `--wasm-fuzzer-gen-test` more as a template to create the actual regression test. Sometimes we don\u0027t need to execute at all, but `builder.toModule()` is enough to trigger the bug, maybe together with `--no-wasm-lazy-compilation`.\nBut adding the try-catch here doesn\u0027t hurt, it can still easily be removed when minimizing the test manually.",
