      "message": "We used to unroll some critical loops in builtins and it seems that there is positive impact to speedometer2. https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/4022363\n\nNow I\u0027m looking at the loop to search polymorphic IC. But before trying loop unrolling to it, I found that we can optimize the assembly codes with some tricks. These tricks include the changes to both CSA and Turbofan. Please take a look at the commit message.\n\nMany of the tricks might be extended to other use cases. Please let me know if you prefer to separate these tricks into different CLs. Thanks!",
