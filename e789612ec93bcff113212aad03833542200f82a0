      "message": "We actually needed the second try/catch for calling `ResolveAPromiseWithValueAndReturnIt`. When I removed it, I got a DCHECK failure in `Throw` here. When `Throw` is called, the isolate should not have any exception. So we need to clear the exception from isolate before this line, and it is better to do it in a try/catch instead of manually changing it.",
