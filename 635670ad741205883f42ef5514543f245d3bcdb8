      "message": "I think we\u0027re not yet on the same page here. I though this group to be a CC of everything we notify on. E.g. if we already notify anyone (blamelist, sheriffs or an owner) we\u0027d now additionally notify v8-infra-cc. Ideally in the exact same way as the other notification, e.g. on new failures, if the other is also on new failures. But if a builder has no notification, let\u0027s also not add the infra-cc. E.g. not here, since as I assume, nobody gets notified now.\n\nIf we as infra team want to get alerted on certain builders, we should use the other v8-infra alert group.\n\nAs implementation, maybe it\u0027s easiest to just add v8-infra-cc group as address in all the other notifiers? Or create a v8_notifier base function that always adds the cc group? Or add it using a generator in the end?",
