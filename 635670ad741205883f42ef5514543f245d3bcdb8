      "message": "I think we\u0027re not yet on the same page here. I though this group to be a CC of everything we notify on. E.g. if we already notify anyone (blamelist, sheriffs or an owner) we\u0027d now additionally notify v8-infra-cc. Ideally in the exact same way as the other notification, e.g. on new failures, if the other is also on new failures. But if a builder has no notification, let\u0027s also not add the infra-cc. E.g. not here, since as I assume, nobody gets notified now.\n\nIf we as infra team want to get alerted on certain builders, we should use the other v8-infra alert group.\n\nAs implementation, maybe it\u0027s easiest to just add v8-infra-cc group as address in all the other notifiers? Or create a v8_notifier base function that always adds the cc group? Or add it using a generator in the end?",

      "message": "Indeed, I was under the impression we only care about not introducing more spam. You want to be able to assess the amount of existing spam? Pls note that if we are present in multiple notifiers with the same email address we will probably get multiple notifications for the same builders (luci-notify should treat every notification as a distinct concern). Do we want to see all notifications in our cc group? If want to address a certain spam complaint we can add ourselves on demand. And if we want to preemptively analyze the amount of existing spam we could do that from luci-notify logs.",
