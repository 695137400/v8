      "message": "Darius: PTAL.\n\nMartyn: Does this patch makes sense to you? I think that bit of functionality was just missing, and it is admittedly hard to test the case where it\u0027s needed.\n\nSpeaking of tests: in the wild, this is currently being hit by the \"1Password\" Chrome extension when `--turboshaft-wasm` is enabled. I haven\u0027t spent the time to figure out why Turbofan isn\u0027t triggering it; presumably it just gets lucky. I have an artificial repro that creates the situation described in the commit message (and works with both optimizing compilers), but it takes ~90 seconds (TS) / ~200 seconds (TF) to run in an arm64.optdebug simulator build, so I\u0027d prefer not to check that in. We could try to craft a cctest repro that uses the `MacroAssembler` directly, which should be faster, but that would have the drawback of being decoupled from our compilers\u0027 production behavior.",
