      "message": "Did you have something like this in mind? I used TaggedEqual as an example, but I\u0027m not sure if the nodes for changing to compressed are necessary - we use EmitIdentity for them in the selector anyway, I suspect they will also soon be gone?\n\nWhen looking for SmiSub, I spotted the code in CodeStubAssembler which I found a little confusing: https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git/+/refs/heads/master/src/codegen/code-stub-assembler.h#614\n\nThe size of tagged signed type was recently changed to 32-bit: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/1815134/10/src/codegen/machine-type.h#444\n\nbut the bitcast nodes BitcastTaggedToWordForTagAndSmiBits and BitcastWordToTaggedSigned still casts between tagged signed and word (which for 64-bit platforms are 64-bit AFAIK). Is this something else that will be updated soon?",
