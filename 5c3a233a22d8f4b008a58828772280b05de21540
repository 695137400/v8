      "message": "Drive-by comment. Can I ask why we are only doing this for x64 right now? Arm64 has some challenges regarding arguments (due to it\u0027s stack having to be 16 byte aligned) and I would much prefer we had something we knew would be workable on all architectures before we start landing code. Is there a design doc with the plans here?",
