      "message": "Thanks for all the effort you put into this, Shu!\n\nInteresting, that this approach seems to cause a regression on ReactRedux on the M1, whereas the initial approach that caused a regression on EmberJS-Debug even improved that line item (according to pinpoint).\nI am more and more convinced that the regressions are due to layout changes/different cache behaviour. Reducing code size of the builtin by replacing the call to the C-function with Unreachable also recovered (most) of the original regressions and shows similar results to the ones here (https://crrev.com/c/3933557).",
