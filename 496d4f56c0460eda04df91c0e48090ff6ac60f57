If it\u0027s somehow implicitly used by being the first in the list, it\u0027s fine to keep; but perhaps needs a small comment or at least a DCHECK somewhere or so; it\u0027s not entirely obvious from reading this CL.",

      "message": "Currently this sequence is a copy of ParseClassDeclaration, but I guess you could use the slightly cheaper sequence for the Token::CLASS case in ParsePrimaryExpression (class expression instead of class declaration). That entire sequence would be a 1-1 copy, so simply extracting that body of the Token::CLASS case into a helper function returning a ClassLiteral* (ClassLiteral* ParseClassExpression()) and calling it here would make sense.\n\nBasically I think you can hook into that code much earlier than you were doing previously with DoParseClassLiteral because everything is more uniform by now; which is great! Hence I think you can drop the DoParseClassLiteral function and merge it back with ParseClassLiteral.",
