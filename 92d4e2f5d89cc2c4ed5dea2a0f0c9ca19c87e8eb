      "message": "I understand your confusion. Let me give a short introduction about this CL and my motives and goals for it.\n\nI\u0027m working on NodeJS supporting Windows. In Node, we periodically update the V8 engine. When updating to V8 11.2, we noticed issues with cross-compilation from x64 to arm64 (Node uses MSVC). I started investigating that and found the issues I am addressing in this CL.\n\nGiven that this is my first contact with the V8 source code, my knowledge of it is extremely low. That\u0027s why I aimed to mostly add changes that would not affect anything that\u0027s already working (thus wrapping all my changes in \"#ifdef V8_MSVC_X64_TO_ARM64\"). Also, my main focus is enabling V8 compilation as a part of Node.\n\nSo, to answer you in short, this is meant as a band-aid mainly because of my lack of knowledge about V8, but if you and/or other reviewers can offer some guidance I\u0027d be open to working on this and making it a real fix.",

Instead of all the `#ifdef`s, the code would be a lot more maintainable long-term if we find a way to rewrite it such that it works on all compilers and platforms.\n\nAs this CL does several things at once, you could also try splitting it into multiple CLs which might make reviewing and iterating on it easier.",
