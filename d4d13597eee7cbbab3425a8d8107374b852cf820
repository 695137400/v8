      "message": "Right, that\u0027s the reason to do it in a separate method.\nI thought about storing it in the vector, like the previous `ZoneVector` implementation does. It would not be too bad, but since it\u0027s only needed in very few places, I thought it\u0027s nicer to just pass it as a parameter where needed.\n\nWe can still revisit this if we start using FastZoneVectors more.",
