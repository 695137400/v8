      "message": "We have general helpers in heap-utils.h that we can use them without the mixin, they only require the heap-utils include. Giving them a default param is problematic though, which is the downside.\nDespite that, I\u0027m leaning towards collecting all GC methods in heap-utils and having all of them in the same place. I view this test-utils.h file as equivalent to cctest.h and we moved all the helpers out of cctest.h.\n\nIdeally we could move everything to heap-utils and have a default param, but I think we need to choose between them (unless we want to use macros).\n\n(Imo, also ideally, more tests that require GC would use the heap mixin, but I don\u0027t plan to start converting tests.)",
