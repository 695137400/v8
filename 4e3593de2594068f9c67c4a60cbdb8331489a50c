Previously, we would only keep track of one (and prioritize source maps).\n\nWith this change, we can decide on the front-end side which symbols to use, if multiple are available.\n\n@clemensb@chromium.org: Here is a design doc, which I previously sent to Emanuel: go/chrome-devtools:warnings-on-multiple-debug-symbols-design\n\nPTAL!",
