      "message": "Could you elaborate the need for changing the field name? wall_clock_time_in_us was chosen to distinguish it from a potential cpu_time_in_us to be added in the future. I\u0027m not seeing how duration_in_us adds any better explanation of what the field means and since it requires a 2-step change, I think there should be a good motivation for that.",
