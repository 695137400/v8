      "message": "This was the smallest obvious fix that I could see.  Since GraphTest is used in other source files, moving it into the graph_unittest namespace would require modifying a bunch of other source files.  Doing this would also require some changes to the GraphTest code: the zone() calls fail with \"use of undeclared identifier\" errors, and I would need to figure out why.",
