      "message": "LGTM.\n\nMeta-comment: as you can see above, the diff view for this patch is pretty useless, which makes reviewing difficult. It\u0027s better to do \"move+refactor\" changes as two CLs, or at least two separate patch set uploads: one that moves, one that refactors. That way, reviewers can simply skip over the move, and get a convenient view of what the refactoring changes did.",
