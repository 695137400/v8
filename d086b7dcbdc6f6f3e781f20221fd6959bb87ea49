      "message": "Adding mlippautz since I\u0027m not a base owner.\n\nNico, ptal at the comment on your initial CL - I think we should change our approach and remove the DCHECK. It was initially introduced in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/1701127 for the iPhone. I\u0027d suggest reverting your initial fix and replacing the section by something like:\n\n #if V8_TARGET_OS_IOS \u0026\u0026 V8_TARGET_ARCH_ARM64\n  raw_addr \u003d RoundDown(raw_addr, 1 \u003c\u003c 14);  // iOS uses 16 KiB memory pages.\n\nmlippautz wdyt? This will still apply the wrong raw_addr transformation in GetRandomMmapAddr during mksnapshot in cross-builds, but tbh I don\u0027t think we care much.",

      "message": "I am currently wondering why we alway use V8_TARGET_ARCH_* for something that is only executed on the host :) \n\nIf we do host arch detection we can assume page sizes, fix GetRandomMmapAddr and even have DCHECKs asserting our assumptions.\n\n(All of this code is a mess and before we had OWNERS in place it was a dumping ground for quickfixes.)",
