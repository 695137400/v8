      "message": "I would prefer these methods to be named \u0027IntlOptions\u0027 instead of \u0027Options\u0027 to avoid accidental misuse. ecma262 doesn\u0027t yet have a uniform way of dealing with options bags (for example, Error.cause has a Has and a Get, resizable ArrayBuffers have a plain Get) unlike ecma402+Temporal. The 262 editors will talk about what to name these AOs eventually, and when we decide that we can rename these functions to match. Until then I don\u0027t want to give the impression that these are for all options bags.",
