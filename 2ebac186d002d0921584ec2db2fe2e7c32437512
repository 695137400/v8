      "message": "IIUC, the current design requires that the users put a DeferTraceToMutatorThreadIfConcurrent() call into trace that does the right thing. This allows us to push the Trace() callback to the regular worklist as it will re-organize itself upon first execution.\n\nWe may have discussed this already, but I\u0027d suggest a slightly different design:\n- Use TraceTraits\u003cT\u003e to specify something like kCanTraceConcurrently.\n- Introduce Visitor::VisitOnOwningThread() and decide in Trace(T*) which Visit() method to call. (This avoids blowing up TraceDescriptor for the fast case.)\n- Adjust the write barrier (see below)\n\nThe tricky part is adjusting the write barrier to push to the right queue directly. AFAICS, we can add a bit to GCInfo that tells us whether concurrent tracing of an object is supported. \n\nAt some point we need to bring GCInfo merging back to the library. We can just avoid merging if we see that we need non-concurrent tracing. In practice all the Blink use cases for non-concurrent tracing are leaf objects without big hierarchies, so there\u0027s anyways no merging.\n\nThe big benefits are that users don\u0027t care and that we don\u0027t need to re-organize our worklists internally.\n\nwdyt?",

      "message": "We\u0027ve discussed this before for blink but never reached a conclusion.\n\nOne issue I see is that of \"partial\" deferrals, such as in [1]. We generally trace WTF::Vector concurrently since it\u0027s just the backing store that is unsafe. For vectors with inlined buffers we defer just the tracing of the buffer. That would not be possible with type-based deferral.\n\n[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/blink/renderer/platform/wtf/vector.h;drc\u003d29b0ea0b2982c5b2e5ee394df430ab5267dfcea0;l\u003d2169",
