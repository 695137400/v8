It resets current_block_ in RawMachineAssembler to null and the following node creation will fail. But I\u0027m not sure AbortCSAAssert is a good solution or not...",

      "message": "To me it\u0027d be more obvious to make sure the C++ function is never called when TPH is enabled s.t. we can `DCHECK(!FLAG_enable_third_part_heap)` inside it. Doesn\u0027t make sense to me to emit known dead code in builtins.\n\nIf that\u0027s not feasible for some reason, I guess a runtime `CSA_CHECK(this, Int32FalseConstant())` would be fine too in non-production builds.",
