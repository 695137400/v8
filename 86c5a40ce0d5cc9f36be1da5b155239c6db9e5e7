      "message": "Hi Deepti and Tobias,\n\nThis is a related patch to #3411357 (Add RevectorizePhase), which implements the decision and transformation of 256-bit AVX as described in the design doc. PTAL. Thanks!\n\nI\u0027ve added more tests to check the results after transformation. But seems we cannot run the test-run-* cases through trybot as revec is disabled by default. We may try temporarily enable it for the test. The trybot is currently blocked by a merge conflict with Jie\u0027s patch. I will rerun them later.\n\nBesides, we still have other patches on register allocator support, instruction selection and code generation for 256-bit operators. We will submit them in the following weeks. ",
