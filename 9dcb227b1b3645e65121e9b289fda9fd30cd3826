      "message": "Michael, starting this review with you, before bringing everyone in.\n\nA change to base::bit_cast was just landed in Chromium (https://crrev.com/c/5094596) to enforce correct usage, and I’m trying to land an equivalent change in V8. I am not someone who has any knowledge of how V8 works, so I’m looking for an overall review and your thoughts about this.\n\nIs this reasonable to want to do?",
