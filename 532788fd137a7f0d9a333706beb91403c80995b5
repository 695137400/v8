      "message": "I think one argument in favor of this approach is that it doesn\u0027t suddenly make a fairly cheap operation (writing an external pointer value to an object) expensive (it could trigger reallocation or even GC of the table). The other reason, as ishell@ pointed out, might be that currently, write operations are not expected to trigger something complex like GC, which could cause other trouble.\nIt seems to me that an uninitialized external slot should be quickly caught during testing as it should lead to a crash most of the time, but maybe I\u0027m a bit too naive here :)",

      "message": "Well in this prototype it is, later on it might be allocated in some other way (e.g. it could grow downwards from the start of the 4GB heap region). But yes, it\u0027s unlikely that it will be allocated through the V8 heap allocator. However regardless of how it is allocated, it could still be the case that an allocation of a new table entry would require a table GC (if some maximum size is reached or something like that) which then probably also requires a \"normal\" GC to figure out which entries are alive, no?",
