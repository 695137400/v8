I\u0027ve put my notes in the CL description but I\u0027ll re-iterate here:\n\nI\u0027m getting \"undefined symbols\" for v8Provider+related things inside cctest/libplatform/test-tracing.cc. I tried including the v8-provider.h at the top of the test file, but I\u0027m still getting the same message, so I\u0027m wondering if I\u0027m misunderstanding how the testing infrastructure works. Any resources I can look at?",
