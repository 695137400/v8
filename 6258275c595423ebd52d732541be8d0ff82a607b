      "message": "(Assuming this or a functionally equivalent flag gets passed in when the loaded page has COOP+COEP.)\n\nAs Adam said, in order to keep the feature detection capability, the standard behavior is that the SharedArrayBuffer global property is only present when COOP+COEP are present.\n\nThe presence of the SharedArrayBuffer global property is orthogonal to whether postMessage throws when passed a SAB. Even when COOP+COEP are not present, it is still possible to get at an SAB using WebAssembly.Memory. In that case, passing it to postMessage throws.\n\nDoes that clear it up?",

      "message": "I think so. What I meant above is if a page tries to construct a SAB without COOP+COEP, it\u0027s going to get an undefined-is-not-a-function exception, when migration plans might prefer one that gives an informative message in the Dev console.\n\nAgree that detecting SAB in PostMessage in Blink is orthogonal.\n\nFor now we have to leave SAB and Atomics on all pages on desktop, where --harmony-sharedarraybuffer is enabled by default to not change visible behavior.\n\nIt\u0027s tricky to use the new flag without changing existing desktop behavior. Ultimately we will always add Atomics and the SAB function on the global object only if the --cross-origin-isolated flag is set.",
