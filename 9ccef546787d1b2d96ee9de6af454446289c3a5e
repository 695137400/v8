      "message": "Benchmarks like S3 and J2 are not significantly affected by this line of CLs. The difference is in the range of noise (between Â±0.2%).\n\nHowever, the following numbers are from S3:\n\n22% of all weak refs are maps and only 4% are really non-trivial. So, this CL reduces the number of non-trivial weak refs by a factor of roughly 5.\n\nFiltering out marked non-trivial weakrefs in parallel (in [a subsequent CL](https://crrev.com/c/5676548)) will get rid of ~75-80% of the non-trivial weakrefs. For the remaining 20-25%, we are doing two passes: one in the parallel filtering job and one for actually clearing, in the atomic pause. This CL reduces the time spent in both passes (by a factor of 5). I think this is important because the filtering job runs in parallel only to the sweeping of the external, trusted, and code pointer tables, before being joined.",
