      "message": "Can you clarify what the internal accounting that needs to stay up to date? Not sure if I\u0027m missing anything here, but the problem I see is that we AdjustAmountOfExternalAllocatedMemory for the difference in pages, Unregister adjusts for -old_length, register then adjusts for new_length (\u003d old_length + pages), so we adjust twice for the difference in pages. I think it would be more intuitive to have an interface to the tracker that adjusts the length (byte_length, and memory adjustment above) instead of registering/unregistering here.",
