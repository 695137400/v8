      "message": "dsanders11 reports at https://chromium.slack.com/archives/CGJDZJVG9/p1659111508517399 that this creates a hazard: since it changes the size of objects defined in V8 header files, trouble will ensue when V8 is compiled with `-DDEBUG` (e.g. because of `dcheck_always_on`) while its embedder is not, or vice versa. (In fact, I wonder why this hasn\u0027t caused problems for Chromium builds, where AFAIK `dcheck_always_on` implies `-DDEBUG` for V8 but not for the rest of Chrome.)\n\nOne possibility is to propagate `-DDEBUG` to Ninja targets depending on V8 (or more specifically, on these headers). I was wondering whether there\u0027s also a possibility to avoid the issue in the first place by making sure that the sizes of public objects don\u0027t change depending on preprocessor variables.",
