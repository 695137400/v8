      "message": "PTAL.  This patch enables ExternalPointerHandle for all external pointers when pointer-compression is enabled, regardless of the sandbox.  Had to rebase on top of Dmitry\u0027s patch to enabled shared read-only space in multi-cage contexts, because of external pointers in the snapshot.  We are buying a reduction of the configuration-space size by paying some concessions to the multi-cage configuration; I think it pays off but do let me know.",
