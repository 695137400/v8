I only saw this flying by: What is up with \"jumbo\" here? \n\nJumbo builds have officially been deprecated afaik and there\u0027s no discussion/bug/document that would suggest otherwise. Did I miss anything and there was an announcement that this is being reversed?\n\nI was personally sympathetic to jumbo effort and as it helped especially non-Googlers but I also think we should respect the call from eng leads (even if some of them have left by now). We should almost certainly not spend time fixing unsupported modes without tracking bugs and bots as they could (and history tells us would) constantly break.",

You are replacing an existing style with a new style; both being rather subjective if there\u0027s no actual other reason this is done. Leszek already asked around what others think and so on. This binds time and people.\n\nWe do encourage code cleanups and refactorings but they should have a dedicated reason (e.g. printf vs streaming; uniform usage of flags for tracing) but they should come with a short description and are ideally scoped in a way that they have an end.",
