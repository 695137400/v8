      "message": "I think we added this mostly to avoid additional work if we already have optimized code on JSFunction. With TP + tierup it is possible that we have TP code on JSFunction but TF code on Feedback vector. So we should still check feedback vector. I don\u0027t think it is performance critical so I just dropped this check. We could modify the check to check for top tier code (TF or TP with FLAG_turboprop_as_toptier) but I felt it is simpler to drop this check. Happy to update the check if it\u0027s better.",
