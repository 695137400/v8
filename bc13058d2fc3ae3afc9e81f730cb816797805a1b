      "message": "Hi Liviu. Can you please take a look at this CL? We are getting a failure related to the infrastructure on `v8_full_presubmit` (and it is probably also making exceptions on Fuchsia debug builder https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/v8/builders/luci.v8.ci/V8%20Fuchsia%20-%20debug%20builder). We have tried to figure the issue out, but we had no success. I would appreciate it if you take a look.",

Reverted with a reland in flight.\n\nPls note that if you run locally `./tools/v8_presubmit.py` you will see the same failure AND a bunch of tq and mjs files reformated.
