I wouldn\u0027t want to silently get a single group when I intended to get multiple -- I\u0027d rather V8 tell me loudly that I have built it wrong, so I can go fix that.\n\nAlso perhaps in the future there will be settings that can be passed to customize the group, e.g. maybe passing in a custom PageAllocator instance or something like that. In that case falling back to the global group would mean ignoring any such settings, which doesn\u0027t feel right.",
