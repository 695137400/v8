      "message": "Brendon, this is the stuff I was talking about in your CL (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/4480171). We could probably change this around so that on LSan and HWAsan builds we use fat entries and separate the tag and the pointer completely. However, that\u0027d require a bit more work than this, in particular, all paths that load an external pointer would need to be modified to correctly handle fat entries I think. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s worth the effort (at this point in time), so we can also just disable the sandbox for HWAsan. Let me know what you think!",
