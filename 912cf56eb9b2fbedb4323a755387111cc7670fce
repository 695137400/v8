      "message": "Not sure what you mean by \"not worth separating them\", do you mean not worth having the fast path because only this line differs?\n\nThere are two differences:\n\n1. You can use the `Unmodified` versions of the iterators, which are faster.\n2. Instead of calling the `has` function, you can directly check for membership in the other `OrderedHashSet` or `OrderedHashMap`.\n\nMy intuition is the fast path is worth having for (2) alone. Calling a JS function is much slower than directly checking for membership in a table.",
