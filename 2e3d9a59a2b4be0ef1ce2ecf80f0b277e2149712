      "message": "suggestion: Is there some sort of predicate that we could DCHECK here to ensure that guard pages are enabled (on 64-bit platforms)? Basically something that would require someone changing that invariant in \"wasm-memory.cc\" to stumble over this piece of code here. I couldn\u0027t find any such predicate, but maybe there is one I am not aware of.",
