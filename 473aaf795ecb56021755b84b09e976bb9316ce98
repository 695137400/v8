Especially in the case of the Interpreter comment, it can read as applying to all builtins in that section. Thoughts on how to improve that?",

I could also change this comment to be something like: \"InterpreterEntryTrampoline dispatches to the interpreter to run a JSFunction in the form of a bytecode\". A bit repetitive but makes it clearer?",
