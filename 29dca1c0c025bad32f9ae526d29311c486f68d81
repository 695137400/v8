      "message": "High level: I think the main idea to expose these methods was to be able to actually test the reducer properly. E.g., we could have unit tests for the state machine.\n\nTo actually have such tests, we should probably have something like \n```\nstruct MemoryReducerProvider {\\\n virtual bool HasFragmentation() \u003d 0;\n virtual bool HasLowAllocationRate() \u003d 0;\n virtual bool ShouldOptimizeForMemoryUsage() \u003d 0;\n virtual void SampleAllocation(...) \u003d 0;\n  // ... many more\n}\n```\n\nI wonder if this would desirable at some point. We should definitely try to improve test coverage if possible.",
