Furthermore, it seems that there were some plan for a new one according to the comment here: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/wasm-module.cc;l\u003d242?q\u003dIsWasmCodegenAllowed\u0026ss\u003dchromium.\n\nI think It\u0027d be worth rethinking about this when the new API is introduced, so that we can incorporate the error message in there.",
