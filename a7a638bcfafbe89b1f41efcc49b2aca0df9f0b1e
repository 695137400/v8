      "message": "The reason of no measurable performance improvement is that the proportion is small. I think we can get measurable performance improvement if running a micro case. The added logic is not complex. So the question is, a small modification can improve performance in few cases, is it worthy? I\u0027m ok whether you think it\u0027s worthy or not.",
