      "message": "nit: I am not sure about this implication, I\u0027d keep the two flags separate. I see that the stress mode is \"useless\" if the code GC is not enabled, but keeping it a no-op in that case still makes sense in my mind. I am just trying to keep the implications to a minimum in general. WDYT?",

      "message": "The gc-stress bots do not run the \u0027future\u0027 variant, so without the implication we would have to add both \u0027--wasm-code-gc\u0027 and \u0027--stress-wasm-code-gc\u0027 to the variant.\nMy thinking was that if someone adds \u0027--stress-wasm-code-gc\u0027, they probably want to test wasm code gc, so we should also enable it then. But I am also aware of the issues that flag implications tend to create, so I am a bit undecided here.",
