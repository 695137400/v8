      "message": "It\u0027s changing what used to be a --trace-ignition flag on mksnapshot (kind-of compile time), to enabling/disabling printing at runtime. So --trace-ignition becomes a runtime flag (activating printing), and v8_enable_trace_ignition is the new compile-time flag (controlling the existence of the feature), while previously --trace-ignition controlled the existence and printing was unconditional. Does that make sense?",

Compiling with v8_enable_trace_ignition but keeping the runtime flag off is reasonable, mksnapshot is one example, debugging an ignition issue without having to recompile for tracing is another.
