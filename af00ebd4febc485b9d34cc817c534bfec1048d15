      "message": "If we are lowering a CheckedCompressedToTaggedPointer in the effect linearization phase we will change that to ChangeCompressedPointerToTaggedPointer. Then, we might end up with a chain of:\n    Parent \u003c- ChangeCompressedPointerToTaggedPointer \u003c- ChangeTaggedToCompressed \u003c- Child\nSimilarly, we have cases with Signed instead of pointer.\nThen, we have to be able to accept these types of chains.\n\n@Jaro, should we change something else on the code to avoid these types of chains? Or are we okay with having a IrOpcode::IsDecompressOpcode here? The downside would be that we could be missing wrongly created Change nodes that we are simplifying.",
