      "message": "A few thoughts:\n\nI think an additional stack move in the Smi case could have a noticeable impact on performance.\n\nCurrently we save and restore \"param_count\" at each param builtin call. I think that this is no longer necessary with the suggested change, since \"param_count\" is not used until it is reloaded after \"return_done\". So this could be a small speed-up for the builtin case.\n\nI still think optimizing the Smi case is important if we want the comparison with TurboFan-generated wrappers to be fair. But I am fine with leaving that for later, if we even observe a difference. The suggested change looks good.\n\nRelated side note: I just noticed that we use the same register for the \"thread_in_wasm\" flag (r12). I am wondering how that works currently since we seem to expect \"param_count\" to be live until the end of the builtin (we never set it to \"no_reg\"). It\u0027s getting hard to keep track of live ranges manually, though, maybe it is correct.",
