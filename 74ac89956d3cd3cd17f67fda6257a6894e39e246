      "message": "Hi Toon.\n\nI uploaded a fix for  bug chromium:1156498 and included some comments and insights of what I think is happening. Could you  review the change and confirm if what I am saying is correct?.\n\nThe original report had a large script as a test. I made a minimal repro that is included as the regress test. The problem was caused by a \"pause on exception\" called on a static initializer inside a class inside a function that needed context. As I comment in the description, my fix changes some behavior of the scope chain for this scenario, so I had to modify the expected output of one of the inspector tests.\n\nThanks,\nLuis Fernando Pardo Sixtos",
