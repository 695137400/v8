      "message": "Isn\u0027t this redundant with `V8_HOST_ARCH_ARM64`? As in that if the host is not Arm64 (windows or linux) then `USE_SIMULATOR` should be on anyway. Did you consider adding the `V8_OS_WIN` condition inside `V8_HOST_ARCH_ARM64`?\n\nAs in:\n\n#if defined(V8_HOST_ARCH_ARM64)\n#if defined(V8_OS_WIN)\n  ::FlushInstructionCache(GetCurrentProcess(), address, length);\n#else\n  // The code below assumes user space cache operations are allowed. The goal\n  // of this routine is to make sure the code generated is visible to the I\n  // side of the CPU.\n  \n  ...\n#endif\n#endif\n\n\nThen we wouldn\u0027t need to check the `USE_SIMULATOR` macro.",
