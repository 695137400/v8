      "message": "I agree that this is a lot better than the old implementation where a `if (include_numeric_types)` below would actually return whether numeric types are excluded.\n\nStill, there isn\u0027t any type safety on this in `GetValueTypeHelper`, so mixing up any of these flags in any of the callers would result in very confusing behavior.\nI\u0027d be in favor to switch to enum classes.\nI\u0027m aware that the now simpler `if` then becomes `if(static_cast\u003cbool\u003e(include_numeric_types))` but I think that\u0027s a cheap price to pay vs. mixing these enum values accidentally.\n\nIf you agree, let\u0027s replace these with enum classes here. If you disagree, I can provide an LGTM and we merge this CL. ðŸ˜Š",
