      "message": "FYI the \u0027Builtin Pointer\u0027 name is what we settled on back then for what we call torque\u0027s builtin pointers through the codebase. I guess it\u0027s an implementation detail that the \u0027pointer\u0027 is stored as a smi index so changing the name here seem okayish, but I also like how the name was previously consistent everywhere. \n\nWhat\u0027s the motivation for changing it now, is there a new callsite somewhere that doesn\u0027t have to do with a torque builtin pointer?",
