The v8 target is the architecture for which v8 generates code (possibly simulated).\n\nIf you want correct simulator builds, you should better set both target_arch and v8_target_arch explicitly below. I remember we might infer it, but \u0027explicit\u0027 would safe me from searching that code. E.g. for arm64 simulator we\u0027d need:\ntarget_arch\u003dx64 v8_target_arch\u003darm64\n\nI think in the general case, the host_arch is x64 for all four builds this script is targeted for. So that for arm sim we\u0027d have, e.g.: host\u003dx64 target\u003dia32 v8\u003darm",
