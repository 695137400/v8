      "message": "\u003e Won\u0027t the hint now be kNone due to uninitialized feedback (rather than kAny)? \n\nCorrect, just double-checked.\n\n\u003e For StringComparison it doesn\u0027t matter but I\u0027d hope that it matters somewhere in these tests.\n\nIn js-typed-lowering it does not, see https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:v8/src/compiler/js-typed-lowering.cc;l\u003d41;drc\u003d8581d300388ba3d752e73289dcb702625119e59f?originalUrl\u003dhttps:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F. kNone and kAny are treated equally.\n\nThe only other affected test is typer-unittest and afaict it is also not affected by feedback. Here\u0027s the relevant function: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:v8/test/unittests/compiler/typer-unittest.cc;l\u003d92;drc\u003d8581d300388ba3d752e73289dcb702625119e59f?originalUrl\u003dhttps:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F\n\nMarking as resolved but feel free to reopen if there\u0027s something left to discuss.",
