So the cached items that have been constructed inherit from the incorrect Array.prototype.\n\nSo, I\u0027m at a loss to ensure that this situation can\u0027t happen",

      "message": "Idea I have right now is like this:\n\nSFI has the \"template_object_cache\" field, which has a length 2x the number of tagged templates which occur in its body. Each 2 elements are treated as a pair:\n\nFirst in pair: either a JSArray (the built callsite object), or a FixedArray containing all the strings needed to create it.\n\nSecond in pair: a WeakCell pointing to the NativeContext at the time the JSArray is created. This is used to validate the cached entry, so that it can be re-created if CompilationCache results in the same SFI being used in a different context. The NativeContext is held in the WeakCell to ensure it\u0027s not retained.\n\nIn optimized code, I think most of the time, retrieving the template object can be reduced to a HeapConstant to the cached entry during compilation. Otherwise, it would be best to just make it a stub call.\n\n---\n\nI haven\u0027t come up with any better way to make this work with CompilationCache, other than turning off CompilationCache when tagged templates occur.\n\nDoes this seem like a good way to solve the problem, or are there better options?",
