I like the approach, but I think this does too much currently.\n\nPer the link you gave: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/tools/depot_tools/+/main:cpplint.py;drc\u003d098586197089d3bd63bcdee543c546c5eb4c2bdf;l\u003d169\nI think CPPLINT.cfg should be in src/bigint/, and should only contain one entry:\n\n  -readability/check\n\nThat way, it\u0027ll disable one rule for one directory. We don\u0027t want any files to be skipped entirely.\n\n(FWIW, you don\u0027t need to upload new patch sets for testing; just commit locally and run `git cl presubmit`.)",
