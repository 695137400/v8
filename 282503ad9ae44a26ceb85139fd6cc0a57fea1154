      "message": "There was a comment regarding this in the first CL related to this feature: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/1923407/2/src/wasm/wasm-engine.h#284\nThere was a concern that we could have an ABI break if we build class WasmEngine with V8_ENABLE_WASM_GDB_REMOTE_DEBUGGING set as true, so having the data member \u0027gdb_server_\u0027, and use it from other V8 component compiled with V8_ENABLE_WASM_GDB_REMOTE_DEBUGGING\u003dfalse.\n\nI am not sure if this is really a problem, since we are in v8::internal, but that is the reason for this code. I agree that it would be better to remove this empty-class implementation if this is a non-issue.",

      "message": "Thanks for providing the background.\nI don\u0027t think that we need to worry about linking files compiled with different flags (that generally does not work in v8). Also, I don\u0027t think that this definition fixes this. In order to be (more) ABI compliant independent of build flags, we would need to unconditionally include the gdb_server_ field in the WasmEngine.\n\nBut I think the current conditional inclusion is actually better, and we can just skip the definition here.",
