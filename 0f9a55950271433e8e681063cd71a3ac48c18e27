Isn\u0027t that is what you asked already?\n\n\u003e There\u0027s no need to do a validation for collation when we create a number format object. \nFor the case of number format object, the relevant_keys contains only \"nu\" and therefore even the locale has \"-u-co-xxx\" this will be a IF (false) and will skip all the following.",
