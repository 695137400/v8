      "message": "Hmm.. So if v8 decides to use a larger heap buffer eventually, the clients will crash... on some array sizes? Looks like a landmine to me. We don\u0027t even expose a constant for the max size of inline storage in the API, do we?",

My thought was that it\u0027s best if we crash in that case, so that the API caller sees the issue and can fix it.\n\nI considered handling this case somehow, but I thought it would just hide a bug.",
