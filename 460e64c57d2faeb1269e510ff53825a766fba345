      "message": "Aha, I suspected that I was missing something. Thanks for clarifying!\nInstead of removing the limit, I increased it by a factor of two now. Not sure how much the stack size limitation really tests what it is supposed to test, since in 64kB you can fit a lot of non-return-call frames. And we don\u0027t have a test with *that* many recursive calls. I only call 24 in the factorial :/ ",

      "message": "Maybe we should add a test in this file with more recursive calls, just to test this. But I think it\u0027s very low priority, there are already tests that do exactly this in cctest, see test-run-wasm/ReturnCall*. In these the stack is even smaller and we run thousands of recursive calls.",
