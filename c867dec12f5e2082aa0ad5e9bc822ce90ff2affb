We need a different strategy for those...\n\nNot sure if there\u0027s a good one though. How were chromium trybots switched to reclient? Was there need to sync the switch change with a chrome source side change? If so, we could prepare all changes and then land them roughly in parallel - maybe I\u0027ll take down this bot from blocking CQ for an hour - or land the CLs will fewer folks are working...",

While in Chrome, they at least land together, for the V8 builders, we need a separate mb_config change on the Chrome side, and an infra/config change here.\n\nIf you prepare both changes, I can land them somewhat in sync. E.g. landing our infra/config part right after the chrome side has landed.",
