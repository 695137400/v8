      "message": "Hey Milad, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the way we want to fix this.\nWhen relanding my original CL I was already thinking about that problem and came to the conclusion that with every C++14 compiler this should work because the V8_Fatal function inside UNREACHABLE should never be called in a constexpr context, so this should be okay.\n\nI was wondering what compiler you are using that this doesn\u0027t work. I checked a few gcc versions on godbolt.org but it did indeed work with every single one.\nCan you please share some details? Thanks",

      "message": "Hi Nico,\n\nWe use gcc 8.3 which is the minimum supported compiler version on Node.js:\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/BUILDING.md#supported-toolchains\n\nHere is an example with this version: https://godbolt.org/z/55sf3448v\n\ngcc 9 and up seem to recognize `unreachable` is never executed at compile time and avoids that error similar to clang. We do have plans to upgrade to a compiler supporting C++20 however we need to keep using 8.3 for the time being.\n\nAlternatively `abort();` seems to compile as well.",
