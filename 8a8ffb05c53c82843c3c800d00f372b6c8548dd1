      "message": "The reason why on intel architectures we use {get_bits} instead of {get_scalar} is that on some architectures the compiler is allowed to nondeterministically set the quiet-nan bit when passing float or double by value. Hence we always pass the bit pattern instead.\nIf this is also a problem on mips, you should consider refactoring TurboAssembler::Move to receive an int64_t instead of double (the double is bit_cast\u0027ed to int64_t anyway in that method), and then pass the bit pattern directly.",
