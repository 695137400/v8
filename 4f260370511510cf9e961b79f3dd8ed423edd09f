      "message": "receiver (input) is `JSSet`. We passed an `OrderedHashSet` and get an `OrderedHashSet` as result, so it was not working. I had a couple of options: 1) pass `JSSet` from union instead of `OrderedHashSet`, get the result as `OrderedHashSet` and update `.table` inside the `JSSet`. 2) pass `JSSet` from union instead of `OrderedHashSet`, and get the result as `JSSet`. 3) pass `OrderedHashSet` from TF builtin, and change `AddToSet` code in lines 1593, 1646, and 1647. \nI did option 1 because of the discussions we had yesterday, but I feel updating `.table` of the JSSet everytime (line 64 in `set_methods.tq`) is not optimized. I think the second option is better. We should change the `TF builtin` again and remove line 1583. What do you think about them?",
