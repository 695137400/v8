      "message": "I\u0027m not sure whether we need to make the conversion to `HeapObjectReference` explicit, because `CAST` need the \"to type\" to be convertible to `TNode\u003cObject\u003e` https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/compiler/code-assembler.h;l\u003d428 We might also want to use this CAST only when the \"from type\" is MaybeObject.\n\nIf not, I think a possible solution is to make the conversion from MaybeObject to HeapObjectReference a special case in CAST, and do not let it go through original checks but add some new ones. What do you think?",
