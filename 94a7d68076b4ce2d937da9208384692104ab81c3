      "message": "This invocation is not gc-safe, I am actually scared that GC-mole is not flagging this. The issue underlying this is somewhat quirky. For C++ it is not fully specified whether in the \"a-\u003e(*foo())\" pattern the dereference of a happens before or after foo() is called. This means the compiler could dereference the {frame} handle before actually calling {NewStackFrameInfo} which triggers a GC. The solution is simply just calling {NewStackFrameInfo} in a separate line and hence sequence the order operation in two different statements. Concretely ...\n\nHandle\u003cStackFrameInfo\u003e frame_into \u003d isolate-\u003efactory()-\u003eNewStackFrameInfo(...);\nframe-\u003eset_frame_info(*frame_info);",
