      "message": "Hi Mythri. I ran into this case, where CompileOptimized was called on a JSFunction f s.t. f-\u003eis_compiled() was false (but f-\u003eshared().is_compiled() was true).\n\nDue to the early exit, we didn\u0027t fetch and install the cached Code objects. I think the correct fix is to simply remove the early exit, and let GetOptimizedCode handle these cases. PTAL.",
