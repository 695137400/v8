      "message": "I wonder if turbofan has actual coverage for this. If it had, we had seen this during normal testing.\n\nI wonder if we should maybe add tests in a way that they always benefit maglev and turbofan?\n\nI.e. I think all the turbofan test cases that use OptimizeFunctionOnNextCall are automatically also turned into maglev test cases when passing in --maglev and --optimize-on-next-call-optimizes-to-maglev as a test variant.\n\nBut the reverse doesn\u0027t hold, like we currently don\u0027t use also all the maglev test cases as turbofan cases and e.g. let OptimizeMaglevOnNextCall behave like OptimizeFunctionOnNextCall. Should we?",
