      "message": "+1. RawSlotAt (or a differently-named similar helper) can safely return {char*} or {Address}. The former is the standard C++ solution, the latter is V8\u0027s convention for similar cases.\n\nUBSan reports are real bugs and should be fixed rather than silenced/ignored. That said, since this issue isn\u0027t new (and just flushed out by introducing a test), I would be fine with landing the CL with the NO_SANITIZE annotation and fixing it in a follow-up -- because I can\u0027t easily tell just how many changes would be required, e.g. {operator-\u003e} right above is problematic as well.",
