      "message": "Hello again Leszek,\n\nWould you please take a look at this change? I first tried removing CompilationSubCache as you suggested, but found that CompilationCacheScript and CompilationCacheEval required several precisely identical member functions. In this change, I propose that CompilationCacheScript and CompilationCacheEval can share a base class, but CompilationCacheRegExp does not share anything with the others. I\u0027m open to other options if you prefer something different.\n\nThanks!",
