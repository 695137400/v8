Especially now that the \u0027Scope itself is platform-specific, it wouldn\u0027t provide additional test coverage on other platforms.\nI\u0027d say we can add such a DCHECK if/when we have more than one place where we\u0027d use it, or if an example of an issue comes up where it would have helped to have it.",
