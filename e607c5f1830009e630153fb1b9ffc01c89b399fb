      "message": "Thank you for your patience, I updated signature of CreateSegmentDataObject to drop the unicode_string from it. Unfortunately, I felt that it was safer for it to still grab the UnicodeString out of the icu::BreakIterator so that it could keep calling the Intl::ToString and be fully compatible to original version.\n\nI believe that the underlying structure of UnicodeString is just an array of U16 tokens, so I can potentially drop the Intl::ToString call and use factory-\u003eNewProperSubString() on the input_string. Let me know if you\u0027d prefer me to do so.\n\nAs for removing unicode_string from the Torque files, I\u0027m afraid that it doesn\u0027t sound safe either. Even if we don\u0027t have to use it - it seem that we have to keep a reference to it so that we don\u0027t cause use-after-free.",
