      "message": "PTAL. Patch set 2 is a complete rewrite that implements what we discussed: just work with the on-instance value every time. Using a stack slot to cache the vector (or slot address) wouldn\u0027t save any code, so I skipped that. This is code size neutral compared to the previous dynamic tiering implementation. It might be slightly slower, but reliable tier-up is more important.",
