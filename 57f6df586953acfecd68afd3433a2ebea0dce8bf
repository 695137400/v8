      "message": "Two comments:\n1) It seems like the transition from RUNNING to STOPPED via RaiseException is only used by a test. Maybe we can refactor the test (which only tests activations are accounted correctly), and remove this transition?\n2) We can still go from RUNNING to STOPPED via unhandled exceptions, right? So I think we should keep this transition, and just put \"Exception\" as label.",
