      "message": "Not for now. I only added a minimal extension to the anyref specification to make it comply with the bulk-memory specification, i.e. I just removed all conflicts. {functions_as_elements}, which means flag value \u003e\u003d 4 according to the bulk-memory specification, is not necessary for anyref, and therefore I did not add it. Eventually when anyref is rebased on the bulk-memory specification, we have to extend the code here as well. Until then, this behavior here is correct.",
