I guess it is okay to avoid calling {InitializeAfterDeserialization} if there is an error, is it not? If deserialization fails here, does it even make sense to create a compilation state here?\n\nThe other question is, should {UpdateNativeModuleCache} even be called if the {missing_functions} vector is not empty? I guess if compilation continues later, {UpdateNativeModuleCache} would be called anyways by the normal compilation pipeline.",
