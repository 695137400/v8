      "message": "The problem is that v8 embedders need to initialize v8\u0027s platform by calling v8::V8::IntializePlatform. Otherwise tracing fails when it tries to get a TracingController and doesn\u0027t have a platform. My previous CL broke the sample because it made cppgc actually use v8\u0027s implementation in non-standalone builds, which means it tried to get the v8 platform.\n\nWe can either expose v8_platform here and divulge that DefaultPlatform is based on v8::Platform, or add a method to DefaultPlatform to \"initialize embedded platform\" (or something of the sort). Personally, I think exposing v8_platform makes more sense.\nDo you think differently?",
