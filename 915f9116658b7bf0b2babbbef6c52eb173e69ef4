      "message": "What I noticed was that when the closest outer socpe that needs a context isn\u0027t a CLASS_SCOPE, it may not have PostionInfo at all (e.g. a block scope) then we can\u0027t compare the positions, so this check sort of does the same thing as the one below since maybe_outer_scope_info.ToHandleChecked()-\u003escope_type() \u003d\u003d CLASS_SCOPE implies that the outer scope also has position info. I probably went into a different line of thought when I wrote the check below..I\u0027ll update the check below to match this, thanks for catching it!",
