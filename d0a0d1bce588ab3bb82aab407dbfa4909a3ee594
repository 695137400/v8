      "message": "I guess reserving 10,000 ranges of ~10 MB each is a bit much (although they _should_ get GC\u0027ed). I\u0027d suggest to reduce both iteration count and max length by a few orders of magnitude. (Sorry I didn\u0027t notice the iteration count in the original review.)\n\nMaybe there\u0027s a larger issue here that reserved-but-not-committed capacity of growable array buffers isn\u0027t accounted for in \"external\" allocation size tracking?",
