      "message": "I guess reserving 10,000 ranges of ~10 MB each is a bit much (although they _should_ get GC\u0027ed). I\u0027d suggest to reduce both iteration count and max length by a few orders of magnitude. (Sorry I didn\u0027t notice the iteration count in the original review.)\n\nMaybe there\u0027s a larger issue here that reserved-but-not-committed capacity of growable array buffers isn\u0027t accounted for in \"external\" allocation size tracking?",

Aargh, my reasoning about \"this runs really fast on my machine, and we don\u0027t even really commit all that memory, and the try jobs didn\u0027t complain either -\u003e this is fine\" just failed. I\u0027ll try to see if this reproes with a smaller example too.",
