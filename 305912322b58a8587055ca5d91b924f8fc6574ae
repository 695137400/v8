      "message": "This latest version renames the core macros, names the wrapper macros to expose which core mechanism they use, rolls the helper method into the stream macro (figured out how), and eliminates a stray `CostlyTrace()` instance I missed.\n\nWDYT? Too verbose of names? TBH I think having \"_STREAM_\" in all the wrapper macros isn\u0027t great.\n\nI\u0027d like to get to a point where there\u0027s some kernel we agree is good so I can at least start landing that bit.",

      "message": "yeah, it\u0027s pretty verbose, which means it ends up not really being any more readable than the original code (if at all). I suppose fundamentally, the underlying readability problem is in having multiple ways of printing, and the macros either hide this (in a leaky abstraction way, since you still have to think about the format string), or amplify this (by shouting \"STREAM\" or \"PRINTF\" at you), but don\u0027t solve it.\n\nLet me throw this over to the rest of the team first -- it\u0027s effectively an opinionated style, so I should gather some opinions.",
