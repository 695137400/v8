      "message": "This latest version renames the core macros, names the wrapper macros to expose which core mechanism they use, rolls the helper method into the stream macro (figured out how), and eliminates a stray `CostlyTrace()` instance I missed.\n\nWDYT? Too verbose of names? TBH I think having \"_STREAM_\" in all the wrapper macros isn\u0027t great.\n\nI\u0027d like to get to a point where there\u0027s some kernel we agree is good so I can at least start landing that bit.",

      "message": "yeah, it\u0027s pretty verbose, which means it ends up not really being any more readable than the original code (if at all). I suppose fundamentally, the underlying readability problem is in having multiple ways of printing, and the macros either hide this (in a leaky abstraction way, since you still have to think about the format string), or amplify this (by shouting \"STREAM\" or \"PRINTF\" at you), but don\u0027t solve it.\n\nLet me throw this over to the rest of the team first -- it\u0027s effectively an opinionated style, so I should gather some opinions.",

      "message": "In my local refactoring, I ended up using the stream form 95% of the time, so another way forward would be to only add the stream versions, and if you want the printf version, do it yourself. Or make that one have a noisy name. Or even convert all call sites to stream form; I got partway there but people who want precise spacing and precision then have to use manipulators, which is ugly.",

      "message": "So the feedback from various colleagues is that this doesn\u0027t look like a net improvement, and is more just replacing one opinionated style with another. I think that without some more complete motivation and style proposal doc, signed off by a few people and bikeshedded by the rest, it\u0027s not worth pursuing this further.",
