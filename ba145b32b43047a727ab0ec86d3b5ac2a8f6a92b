      "message": "We can\u0027t push/pop single registers any more, so we\u0027re inlining any lightly used macro assembler function that does this, in order to get an opportunity to merge a nearby push/pop in a subsequent patch. The alternative is pushing extra padding registers, which we\u0027d like to avoid where possible.\n\nLooking at this more closely, I think PopStackHandler() could be kept, as it effectively pops two registers, but having PopStackHandler() with no PushStackHandler() may be confusing.",
