      "message": "We can\u0027t push/pop single registers any more, so we\u0027re inlining any lightly used macro assembler function that does this, in order to get an opportunity to merge a nearby push/pop in a subsequent patch. The alternative is pushing extra padding registers, which we\u0027d like to avoid where possible.\n\nLooking at this more closely, I think PopStackHandler() could be kept, as it effectively pops two registers, but having PopStackHandler() with no PushStackHandler() may be confusing.",

I don\u0027t think PopStackHandler pops two registers (I think the Drop is a drop of zero, since StackHandlerConstants::kSize - kXRegSize \u003d\u003d 1 word - 1 word \u003d\u003d 0 if I calculate it correctly (otherwise I\u0027m a bit confused as to where the extra element popped by PopStackHandler is actually pushed).\n\nI guess this makes sense, but please add some comments before the code in JSEntryStub stating what this is doing.",
