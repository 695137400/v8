PTAL.\n\nAs you can see, I\u0027ve had to move a bunch of stuff from memory-optimization.cc to the header, because MemoryAnalyzer is not Assembler-independent anymore and has an Assembler template parameter and takes an assembler in its constructor... \nI\u0027m OK trying to find a cleaner solution, but I\u0027m also OK to land this sooner as-is rather than later and cleaner... Let me know what you think!",
