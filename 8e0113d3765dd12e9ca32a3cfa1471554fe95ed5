      "message": "After some debugging today it seems like the `JSExternalObject` created in a fast call might be entirely correct, the only issue is just that it gets tagged with the `kWeakObjectTag` somewhere somehow, after ECL. Manually adding a `kObjectTag` tagging to the end of the ECL code creating the `JSExternalObject` did not help the issue.\n\nWould @Samuel Gro√ü have any idea where I should look to figure out why / how / where the tagging happens?",
