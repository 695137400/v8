      "message": "After some debugging today it seems like the `JSExternalObject` created in a fast call might be entirely correct, the only issue is just that it gets tagged with the `kWeakObjectTag` somewhere somehow, after ECL. Manually adding a `kObjectTag` tagging to the end of the ECL code creating the `JSExternalObject` did not help the issue.\n\nWould @Samuel Gro√ü have any idea where I should look to figure out why / how / where the tagging happens?",

You mean the value that contains the pointer to the `JSExternalObject` (so `Node* external \u003d __ Allocate(AllocationType::kYoung, size);`) has the wrong tag (i.e. not https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/include/v8-internal.h;drc\u003d6dc39d60fea45c003424272efdb4c366119a9d7f;l\u003d51)? TF is not my area of expertise, so I wouldn\u0027t know off the top of my head why something like that would happen, sorry!",
