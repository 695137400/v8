Is there a reason you need to add partial support for logging compiles right now?\n\nCould we refactor RecordFunctionCompilation / RecordCompilationStats out of UnoptimizedCompilationJob and use them directly here instead?",

Perhaps a more reasonable refactoring would be to not actually delete the jobs after off-thread compilation, but keep them around in a reduced capacity (e.g allow them to release their data but keep things like compilation stats)?",
