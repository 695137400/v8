      "message": "Hi Leszek and Shu, this CL is a follow-up CL for https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/3816221.\n\nIn the previous CL, we could elide redundant immutable context load in some case like: `a.b \u003d a.c`, but we can\u0027t optimize it in `a.b.bb \u003d a.c`, because the accumulator was changed between generating bytecodes for lhs and rhs.\n\nIn this CL, we could cover this case, PTAL, thanks!",
