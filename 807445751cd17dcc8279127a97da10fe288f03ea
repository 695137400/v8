      "message": "Hello,\n\nI just wanted bring up two questions related to this topic;\n\n- Why can\u0027t you use the current implementation and interpret the allocated FP register number as a Simd register? i.e the allocator returns FP register 5 and you simply use Simd register 5 instead. Of course this method wont work if a direct 1-1 match can\u0027t be made and certain vector registers can\u0027t be used. I can also see how using separate Simd registers could avoid register spilling.\n\n- Some builtins such a `WasmDebugBreak` need to push Vector/FP registers before making a runtime call: https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git/+/refs/heads/main/src/builtins/x64/builtins-x64.cc#2860\nAfter this change, do Simd registers need to also be pushed/popped onto the stack separately from FP registers?",
