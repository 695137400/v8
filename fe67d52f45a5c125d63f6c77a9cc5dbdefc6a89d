      "message": "Drive-by notes and questions...\n1) Note that this list is not complete. In case of API function `CallApiCallback` builtin similarly pushes `v8::FunctionCallbackInfo::kArgsLength` number of values to the stack.\n2) I wonder, would it simplify things if we store just the \"limit\" value in the frame instead of `scan_count` + `original_sp`? Then we could always scan slots from `sp()` to this \"limit\".\n3) Does this frame contain raw non-aligned pointers that can be confused with HeapObject values? Can we let the GC scan the whole frame?",
