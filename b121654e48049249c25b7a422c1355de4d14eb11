      "message": "Upon further investigation this case is entirely in error. What is happening is that when JS calls into JSPI wasm, we don\u0027t return a promise to the JS until the wasm gets suspended. After that point we are in the above added case, but before it we are in a situation where we aren\u0027t in a reaction job, but for some reason the StackFrameIterator won\u0027t iterate past the wasm frames to the outer JS frames even though they have not been suspended. I think this is a bug in StackFrameIterator.",
