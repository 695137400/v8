      "message": "ptal. This should help with some of the regression we saw (which frankly are a bit noisy anyway).\n\nI wanted to run this on pinpoint but that\u0027s not possible because it requires CL in 2 different repos.\nIf we don\u0027t want to wait for everything to roll and see the effect on chrome perf, we can split this CL into 2 parts. The 1st will introduce the batched events and will land first. Then we land the blink-side CL. Finally we switch v8 to report batches. Running the 3rd CL in pinpoint after the other 2 have landed will be possible.\nwdyt?",

      "message": "I debated for a long time between using an array or std::vector here.\nI actually like std::vector better as it means we don\u0027t need to commit to a kMaxBatchedEvents value and we don\u0027t need to explicitly include |num_batched_events|.\nWent with the array approach in the end because I think the code is somewhat simpler and probably a bit faster.",
