      "message": "I introduced this back because I realized on some platforms (PPC / S390) we don\u0027t have an implementation for the builtin yet and my changes would mean it will break even without FLAG_sparkplug. I guess we are close to turning it on by default which will break PPC / S390 anyway. Though I thought maybe it is better to leave it as is in this CL. Happy to go back to earlier version if it\u0027s better that way or do it as a followup CL by informing PPC / S390 owners.",
