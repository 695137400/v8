      "message": "I\u0027m a bit confused by this change. Is V8_UNLIKELY considered always false in the presence of -Wunreachable-code-aggressive? We use V8_UNLIKELY in quite a few places to guide compilation; it would be unfortunate to lose this.\n\nIt seems like there\u0027s a  __builtin_expect_with_probability as well; could we use that instead?",

      "message": "I don\u0027t _think_ it is -- if it is, that seems like a compiler bug, but I was only warned on these locations, which are all of the form V8_UNLIKELY(FLAG_xxx).  I wonder if these flags\u0027 values are known at compile time?  If so, then certainly removing the V8_UNLIKELYs should be harmless to optimization (the code will be dead anyway), although I don\u0027t know why it will silence the warning in that case... if they _are_ known at compile time, we could always do\n\n#if FLAG_xxx\n  ...\n#endif\n\ninstead...",
