      "message": "The reason for introducing all of the complexity around in-construction objects was so that the write barrier cannot blow up any in construction list. E.g.,\n\n  struct GCed : ... {\n   GCed() { global_data_structure.push(this); }\n  }\n\nThe in-construction worklist we have right now does not allow bailing out on duplicates.\n\nCan we get what we initially wanted: An external data structure to do a containments check that allows us to filter dupes, so that we can do:\n\n  if (IsInConstruction(header) \u0026\u0026 MarkExternalBit(header)) {\n    in_construction_object.Push(header);\n  } else if (MarkNoPush(header)) {\n    marking_worklist_.Push(descriptor);\n  }\n\nThis way we bound processing an object by 2 times as in the worst case we have it in the regular worklist and in the in-construction worklist.",
