      "message": "Hi Andreas,\n\nPlease take a look when you have a chance, I also have 3 related questions:\n\n- Is the non torque based js-to-wasm wrapper (arm64 cl https://crrev.com/c/3869197) still used anywhere or the torque based version is the only implementation?\n\n- I didn\u0027t include this param padding which is on arm and ia32: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/arm/builtins-arm.cc;l\u003d3771\nI\u0027m assuming they are there since gp and double registers have different sizes on these platforms so you will need the alignment?\n\n- On the same padding line above, correct me if i\u0027m wrong but wouldn\u0027t it be better to do something like `stack_params_offset \u0026 (kSystemPointerSize -1);` to clear the lower 2 bits or even better `(stack_params_offset + (kSystemPointerSize - 1)) \u0026 ~(kSystemPointerSize - 1)` to align it fully to an upper bound value? current code will just clear the upper bits after `0b100`?",
