This now has cctest coverage, and conforms more closely to the TC39 proposal.\n\n- I tried to find a way around changing the signature of the ModifyCodeGenerationFromStringsCallback, but couldn\u0027t quite get that to work. Is the changing the API callback signature okay? What steps do I need to follow to get this in?\n- I tried to add tests for use with the deprecated AllowCodeGenerationFromStringsCallback, but that wouldn\u0027t compile (because it\u0027s deprecated). Is it okay to leave that untested?\n\n(Usage in crrev.com/c/2340905)",
