      "message": "Patchset #7 introduces a `DCHECK` that sets the precondition under which `GCTracer::NotifySweepingCompleted` is called (to avoid situtations and failing tests like the ones between #4 and #5). This precondition is a bit involved, because heap verification triggers sweeping finalization from within a cycle\u0027s atomic pause (see comment in the code). So `GCTracer::VerifyScope` is introduced, in order to keep track whether we are inside heap verification.\n\nPTAL again.",
