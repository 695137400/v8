      "message": "Hello Jakob and Michael, I found this is failing on ppc. The issue comes from constant pool alignment will potentially increase handler_table_size. From GDB, I read  handler_table_offset_ in code-generator.cc:308 is 8036, after emitting 6 handlers, pc_offset() becomes 8084. But constant_pool_offset will re-align pc_offset to 8088. Therefore, when we compute handler_table_size \u003d constant_pool_offset - handler_table_offset, handler table becomes 4 bytes larger. How would you recommend to fix this? Can I align handler_table_offset to 8 bytes on 64-bit platform too, so that we can avoid alignment later when emitting constant pool?",
