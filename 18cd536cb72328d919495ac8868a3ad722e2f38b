      "message": "LGTM.\n\nDo you think it may be worth adding `CHECK(___.IsSmi())` in the places where we now no longer check for HeapNumber-\u003euint32 conversions? It looks like the affected runtime functions today only need to process Smis, but I\u0027m worried that this is a bit of a trap going forward: limits could change, compiler behavior (e.g. around canonicalizing HeapNumber(42) to Smi(42)) could change, or someone could copy/paste such a snippet to a new function where it\u0027s not correct (which would be hard to detect with tests because it\u0027d work just fine most of the time).",
