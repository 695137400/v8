Maybe fixed sized chunks would be better? Or a second flag for performance measurements, so that the chunks have always the same size?",

      "message": "Yes, I saw that. I actually like what this change uncovered. Performance should be independent of the chunk size, so if we see such unstable results, this is something to fix (see https://crrev.com/c/4329430). Don\u0027t nondeterministic chunk sizes model reality quite well?\n\nIf you want to make it more \"realistic\" by choosing chunk sizes closer to what we see in reality, I am open to that. But fixed sized chunk do not seem to model reality well enough.",
