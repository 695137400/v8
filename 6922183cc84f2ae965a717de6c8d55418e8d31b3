      "message": "I don\u0027t like the solution in this CL. It looks elegant, but it is also unexpected and surprising. I made a suggestion for a different approach. If that one does not work, then I\u0027m fine with the current CL, it\u0027s probably not worth spending more time on this CL. But if it works, then I would prefer that to your current approach.",

      "message": "Would it not be sufficient to pop `sig-\u003eParameterCount()` many values from the stack, and then trap? That would be a bit more code than what you generate now, but it would be much more obvious and understandable. I would also allow the commit message of this CL to be much more understandable.",
