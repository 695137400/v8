If I didn\u0027t misunderstand, Ulan suggested using this to skip the write barrier (see https://crbug.com/v8/8138).\n\nAlso, wouldn\u0027t\n\n Branch(cond, not_in_new_space, \u0026finished) \n\nproduce better code? We could even eliminate the comparison to 0 if we invert the targets:\n\n Branch(WordAnd(...), \u0026finished, not_in_new_space)",

      "message": "Hi Jakob,\n\nAs it turns out, the 2nd optimization you point out isn\u0027t available...the Branch needs at least a word32 representation and the WordAnd operation doesn\u0027t offer that (the CSA verifier fired on this). Per discussion with Tebbi@, it appears the right thing to do is perform a comparison with zero...the resulting code should be adequate.",
