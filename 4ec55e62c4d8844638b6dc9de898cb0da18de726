      "message": "Nice catch! That took me a while to see.\n\nIt\u0027s actually incorrect to call NextFpReg for the SIMD case, as we may get the |extra_double_reg| which we can\u0027t use because it\u0027s always odd, and the following even D-register has been allocated. I\u0027ve changed the code so we allocate SIMD pairs at the start of unallocated registers. We still only need a single |extra_double_reg| slot, since we must be aligned if |extra_double_reg| already holds a register.",
