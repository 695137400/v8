This patch intervene OSR compilation only in the condition that there is no more feedback change.\nIf new feedback was collected while executing the second loop, profiler ticks is reset by IC::OnFeedbackChanged() or CodeStubAssembler::ReportFeedbackUpdate(), the feedback collection state go back to the beginning and start again, the OSR urgency will not increase to more than 0 before accumulating enough no feedback change profiler ticks to meet the condition of SmallEnoughForOSR().",

      "message": "So you\u0027re saying that your patch isn\u0027t necessary if feedback changes (because profiler ticks get reset anyway), and only has interesting behaviour if feedback doesn\u0027t change (because the second loop is included in the first loop)? And you want the second loop to go through the same profiler tick increase as the first loop did, before actually getting compiled?",
